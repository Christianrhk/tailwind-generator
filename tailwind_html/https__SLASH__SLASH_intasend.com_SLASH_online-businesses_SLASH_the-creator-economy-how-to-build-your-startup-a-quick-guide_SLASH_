<p data-block-key="boc7x">It&#x27;s no surprise how much the creator economy is contributing to the current economic landscape. The number of small businesses in the United States has increased by more than 50% since the 1960s, and the number of people who work for themselves has grown by more than 200% since the 1980s. Today, roughly half of the United States workforce is self-employed, and the number of people who make their living in the independent creative economy is expected to increase by another 40% by 2023.</p><p data-block-key="emng4">The creator economy is also responsible for much of the country&#x27;s current economic growth. In 2015, the independent creative economy directly contributed $2.7 trillion to the country&#x27;s gross domestic product (GDP), and it is expected to add another $3.6 trillion to the country&#x27;s GDP by 2023.</p><p data-block-key="3sapb">In 2017, the number of freelancers surpassed the number of traditional employees for the first time. The gig economy is now a $200 billion industry, and it&#x27;s only growing. Companies like Uber, Amazon, and Etsy have changed the way we get around, shop, and do our day-to-day activities. The advent of technology has allowed us to be more productive and efficient, which has made us more comfortable working in the gig economy.</p><p data-block-key="dfrii">The creator economy is upon us. It’s a new phase of the digital age, and it’s here to stay. The creator economy is about the ability to create something online that can then be used by many other people. This new economy is based on projects that are easier than ever before, and they have many benefits for both users and creators alike. It’s this ease of creating that makes the creator economy so powerful.</p><p data-block-key="6eflj">A lot of people are now looking to explore their options in the creator economy where they can create their own opportunities and build their own businesses. This means not only that creators are finding new ways to make money, but also that they are able to build their own community and support others in their community. This is a transition that has not happened before in our lifetime and is a massive shift in the way that we work, socialize and learn. Industries such as animation, game development, and visual effects are heading in this direction, and there are abundant opportunities for those with creative backgrounds to get involved in them.</p><h2 data-block-key="8bees"><b>What is the Creator Economy?</b></h2><p data-block-key="mi1r"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Creator_economy">According to a Wikipedia post</a>, the creator economy is an economy driven by software platforms that allows people to make money from what they create. These platforms are built by artificial intelligence and machine learning, which allows creators to build, update, and scale their products without needing to hire staff or manage the technical side of their business. The platforms also allows creators to reach new audiences and connect with their community. The creator economy is growing and changing the way we do business and interact with each other. It has the potential to change the way we live, work, and play.</p><p data-block-key="5inun">The biggest companies in the creator economy are called content platforms, which allow people to share their work for others to view and comment on. The most well-known content platform is YouTube, which allows people to upload videos and share them with the world. The creator economy has changed the way people make money, and it has also affected the way they work. Instead of working a traditional job, people are creating their own jobs by creating content platforms and making a living from them.</p><p data-block-key="e70dl">It started in the early days of the internet when people uploaded their music, photos, and other creations for others to enjoy. Today, the creator economy is about more than just the internet. It includes everything from the movies we watch to the clothes we wear. It includes the music we listen to and the food we eat.</p><p data-block-key="efuj8">The most famous example of this is YouTube, where users can upload videos and get paid when someone watches their video. The creator economy also includes platforms like Patreon, where people can make money by building content (like videos or blogs) and then getting paid when someone watches or uses that content. The creator economy has allowed people to make a living from creating something they love, while also giving them the opportunity to build a fanbase and share their work with a global audience. The creator economy has changed the way we think about content creation, distribution, and audience growth.</p><p data-block-key="5s342">The creator economy has liberated so many people in terms of how they don&#x27;t have to get involved in traditional jobs any longer. Instead of just one career, people have multiple careers. They can have a career in writing, a career in acting, a career in teaching, a career in business, and a career in investing. This has been a huge benefit for people, and it&#x27;s only going to increase. The best way to think about the creator economy is that it has created millions of small businesses that are generating enormous amounts of value for society.</p><p data-block-key="8gock">It&#x27;s opened up a lot of opportunities so people can be more self-sufficient, and it&#x27;s freed up time to pursue other activities. The best thing about the creator economy is that it&#x27;s going to lead to more innovation and new products and services in the future. It&#x27;s going to change the world for the better. Instead, they can focus on the things they&#x27;re good at and make money doing it.</p><h2 data-block-key="eihg0"><b>Why is the Creator Economy Important?</b></h2><p data-block-key="3rosm">If you&#x27;re a young creator looking to have a successful career in the creator economy, you&#x27;re probably wondering why the creator economy is important in the world today. It&#x27;s the economy of people who use their talents to make a living, and it&#x27;s growing faster than ever before. The creator economy is what enables people to live the life they want - to pursue their passions, build a platform for their voices to be heard, build a community and make a difference in the world, and create art that matters. The creator economy is the future of the economy, and the future is now.</p><p data-block-key="62dj7">This economy is all about supporting the next generation of creators, from emerging talent to those already making a name for themselves. The creator economy will provide a space for creators to express themselves, build their audience, generate income and become industry leaders. It&#x27;s about giving them the resources, platform, and support needed to further their careers and build their businesses. The creator economy is already making an impact in the world today.</p><p data-block-key="bh2i">The creator economy is an economy dominated by the production and distribution of digital media content, such as videos, games, and music. It is growing at a faster rate than the traditional economy, and it&#x27;s expected to become one of the biggest deals by 2025. The creator economy is already transforming the world, and it has the potential to do even more in the future.</p><p data-block-key="c07nj">If you’re wondering why the creator economy is a big deal today, you should check out these three reasons <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbesagencycouncil/2021/11/18/four-reasons-why-the-creator-economy-is-booming/?sh=783fd28253de">inspired by Allesandro Bogliari of Forbes</a>.</p><h3 data-block-key="4pkhd"><b>It is accessible to everyone</b></h3><p data-block-key="f5cec"><a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/330695/number-of-smartphone-users-worldwide/">According to a Statista post</a>, over 6 billion people have a smartphone and 4 billion of them are active social media users, which means as a creator, you already have more than enough audience to reach. What makes the creator economy one of the greatest things to ever happen to us is the fact that everyone has access to it. No matter your background, where you were born, or how much money you have, you can still make something great and get recognized for it. The best thing about this is that it has given us more opportunities in our society. It has allowed us to learn and be exposed to new things that we might not have otherwise. It has also allowed us to learn about cultures and people that we never would have otherwise.</p><p data-block-key="3a5">Because of the democratization of the tools of production and distribution, anyone can create and distribute any kind of content, from music and movies to software and goods. In other words, the creator economy has democratized the tools of production and distribution, making professional content creation and distribution accessible to anyone with a phone and internet access. This has had a profound impact on our society and our economy. For example, independent musicians can now make a living from their music, which was previously only accessible to major labels and industry professionals.</p><h3 data-block-key="ael60"><b>Creators can reach the audience traditional businesses cannot</b></h3><p data-block-key="3fq0h">The goal of content creation is to reach out to a large audience, which is why content creators are very valuable and can reach out to people traditional businesses can’t. They can connect with people in a way that traditional media can’t, and can use their influence to influence people to action. This is why content creators are so important to any company. They can build a brand and help create a positive image for their company, while also helping to build a community of like-minded individuals who are interested in the same types of content. They can use their influence to help spread the word about a company, which is why it’s important for companies to try to find the best content creators possible.</p><h3 data-block-key="crpmq"><b>There’s enough money to be made</b></h3><p data-block-key="f14m2">One thing you should understand about the creator economy is that there is enough money to be made if you can do the hard work. Over the last 30 years, the creator economy has changed significantly and improved beyond what we ever could have imagined. Technology, tools, and automation have made it easier than ever to make a living as an independent creator, which has led to a massive increase in the number of creators in the world, and a corresponding increase in the amount of content being created. It is also creating more opportunities for creators on the margins, as well as giving people new ways to find their calling and make a living. The creator economy is still growing rapidly and will continue to grow in the years to come.</p><h2 data-block-key="d2db3"><b>How To Build A Successful Creator Platform</b></h2><p data-block-key="6ids6">Think about how much platforms like YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, and Facebook among many others have contributed to the growth of the creator economy. As platforms have grown, they have provided more opportunities for creators to build an audience and make money. They’ve also influenced the way we view and consume content, enabling a new kind of celebrity and influencer culture. Just a few short years ago, platforms like YouTube and Instagram were about sharing videos and photos with close friends and family. Today, influencers with millions of followers can make a living off of these platforms.</p><p data-block-key="m9sf">Building a successful creator platform is never easy. There are business models you need to properly examine among a host of other things. Let’s explore them below;</p><h3 data-block-key="9l8tn"><b>Find the problem</b></h3><p data-block-key="3pq53">Instagram, YouTube, TikTok, Facebook, and Medium - what do they all have in common? They’re solving problems! If you don’t have a platform to promote your content, share your story, get followers, or build an audience, you’re missing out on a lot of potential exposure and income. And while these platforms have become essential parts of people’s lives, they’re also making billions of dollars in revenue. That’s why it’s so important to understand how these platforms work, who’s using them, and what’s driving their growth.</p><p data-block-key="6ag9f">The bottom line is simple - if you’re trying to create a good creator platform, you need to be solving a problem. You need to think about the kinds of things people need help with solving, and then build the tools to meet those needs. If you are not solving any problem, it’s unlikely that your users will find value in your platform. Your relationship with your users is what will ultimately define the value of your platform.</p><h3 data-block-key="1fopq"><b>Find your audience</b></h3><p data-block-key="vb00">When creating a creator platform, you need to know who your audience is. Who are you trying to reach with what you are saying? If you can guess, you are more likely to connect with them and convey your message effectively. The more you can narrow down who you are targeting with your message, the better. If possible, find out who you are trying to reach before starting your creator platform.</p><p data-block-key="12b8">It is okay if your target audience is young people, but that doesn’t mean you have to limit yourself to the young. You can also reach out to older audiences by appealing to existing fans. The key to a successful creator platform is to build an audience of targeted users, which means knowing your audience and reaching out to them in the right way.</p><h2 data-block-key="a5mh7"><b>Build a good team</b></h2><p data-block-key="79i5a">Creating a good creator platform that will stand the test of time is not something you can take on alone; you’ll need a team of experts. To build a strong foundation for your brand, you’ll need to enlist the help of an expert founder.  As the creator of a brand’s identity, a founding team is your most valuable asset, so it’s important to find one that is a perfect fit.  A founding team can include co-founders, key employees, advisors, or investors.  The founding team can also include a variety of people, including writers, designers, developers, product managers, customer support, sales, and marketing people.</p><p data-block-key="3olbe">If you’re on the fence about hiring people, you’d be wise to examine the creator platform you’re currently using first to get an idea of what it can do, and how it performs. You’ll see that it won’t be able to do everything you need it to, so it pays to have people on your team who are experts in their field, and who can provide valuable input into your creator platform.</p><h3 data-block-key="52k3o"><b>Funding</b></h3><p data-block-key="29flu">Just like every other startup, creating a good creator platform requires a lot of money, which is where investors come in. Investors are the people who provide the initial funding for this new company. They want to make sure you have thought carefully about the risks and have taken them into account in your business model. They also want to make sure that after the money is raised, they will still have a stake in the company and be able to continue to influence how it is run.</p><p data-block-key="40trq">Just like every other startup, creating a good creator platform requires a lot of money, which is where investors come in. The most common way to raise money is through angel and venture capital investors. They usually invest small amounts of money in a startup at the beginning and provide guidance and mentorship as the company grows.</p><h3 data-block-key="4tkp2"><b>What Are The Skills You Need When Building A Creator Platform?</b></h3><ul><li data-block-key="7rok3">Incredible research skills</li><li data-block-key="bonff">Understanding your audience</li><li data-block-key="1063t">Project management</li><li data-block-key="4pkbf">SEO knowledge</li><li data-block-key="20noe">Brand marketing</li><li data-block-key="5o55i">Writing and design skills</li><li data-block-key="ajuj9">Promotional marketing</li></ul><h2 data-block-key="f37"><b>Finding A Payment Provider</b></h2><p data-block-key="9fcj">Getting paid has always been one of the biggest challenges for content creators and developers, especially if they’re based in Africa. Many people would argue that it’s what payment providers like PayPal, Skrill, and Payoneer do. However, over the years, we’ve realized that these payment providers don’t support African users due to some strict policies and very low exchange rates.</p><p data-block-key="dminn">For many years now, many African developers, creators, and freelancers have trusted <a href="/">IntaSend</a> with their money. Receiving payments via IntaSend is the easiest thing you can ever imagine. You can create and send quick invoices to your clients via IntaSend and choose your preferred payment methods to be paid with. These payment methods include card, ACH, Bitcoin, and mobile money. The other benefits you can enjoy on IntaSend include;</p><ul><li data-block-key="6rgun">Safety</li><li data-block-key="a85t">Round-the-clock customer support</li><li data-block-key="amgsf">API for <a href="https://developers.intasend.com">Shopify and WooCommerce</a></li><li data-block-key="4sltt">Fast payouts</li><li data-block-key="64b69">2-3 days settlement period</li></ul><h2 data-block-key="5haog"><b>Conclusion</b></h2><p data-block-key="ce2rh">One of the best things you can do to help yourself right now is to get involved in the creator economy. This is a whole new world that is emerging as people realize that they can create value, and earn money, by creating things and sharing them online. The tech landscape changes so fast that it’s impossible to keep up with it all.</p><p data-block-key="33ovr">All this wouldn&#x27;t have been possible without the existence of content platforms. They&#x27;re what connect creators to their communities and ultimately to their audiences. Our quick guide on how to build your startup in the creator economy will help you make a real difference while also making money. We&#x27;ve discussed a few things you can do to build your brand and get it to your desired stage.</p><p data-block-key="5bbhm"><i>Photo by</i> <a href="https://unsplash.com/@convertkit?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"><i>ConvertKit</i></a><i> on</i> <a href="https://unsplash.com/s/photos/creators?utm_source=unsplash&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=creditCopyText"><i>Unsplash</i></a></p>
