				In most cases, DeFi lending platforms change their interest rates constantly, according to supply and demand - this is an algorithmic process. As for CeFi lending platforms, interest rates can often be fixed for an indefinite period. Although this can be more stable in the short-term, there can be large and unexpected adjustments in the long-run.			</p>

				7,996 Investors read this Here are the latest DeFi interest rates from the most established DeFi lending and savings platforms, compared with the average interest rates from traditional banks. Leading DeFi Lending and Savings Apps We track the best interest rates paid to depositors at five leading DeFi protocols.			</p>

						<p>
				While most lending DeFi rates vary between 1% and 3%, there are some digital assets that can generate a much higher DeFi yield. At the moment of writing, Curve token had an 11% APY, on the Ethereum network. These rates are subject to change, according to the market.			</p>

						<p>
				In crypto, some DeFi loan servicers (e.g. Aave) will offer a fixed interest rate; most, however, adjust interest rates with each new block on the blockchain. These variable interest rate loans can quickly change depending on current market conditions.			</p>

						<p>
				Users providing capital to BlockFi can choose to collect interest in a number of different assets. This means users can choose to lend Bitcoin and receive USDC or lend USDC and receive interest in Bitcoin. Interest earned on BlockFi is paid out monthly and can be withdrawn at any time.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi Lending Rates The most significant advantage DeFi lending has over traditional financial lending is allowing its users to earn high-interest rates, with earnings ranging between 5% and 15% APY (Annual percentage yield). Earning Protocol Fees DeFi protocols charge modest fees for activities like the lending, swapping, and borrowing of assets.			</p>

				Assets are automatically shifted between lending platforms in the DeFi ecosystem like Compound and Aave, where interest rates for deposited assets change dynamically. Every time a new user deposits...			</p>

						<p>
				Dynamic - The vast majority of borrowing in DeFi leverages variable interest rates which shift relative to the utilization ratio of any given asset. Perpetual - DeFi loans can be opened for any amount of time, so long as the debt is paid back and the position is sufficiently collateralized Top Picks			</p>

						<p>
				This rate has created a rift in the DeFi ecosystem as many lending projects are reliant on the DSR to drive Dai lending rates. The bright side of this rate is that minting new Dai has never been cheaper, with all collateral types having at or near 0% stability fee - meaning there is no incurred debt on an outstanding loan.			</p>

				The DeFi lending market has risen substantially since 2020. The Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols is over $80 billion, increasing more than 20-fold in the last year. Notably, DeFi rates are much greater than those offered in the traditional financial space, making DeFi lending a much better option for earning passive income.			</p>

						<p>
				The interest that lenders receive and the interest, that borrowers have to pay are determined by the ratio between supplied and borrowed tokens in a particular market. The interest that is paid by borrowers is the interest earned by lenders, so the borrow APY is higher than the supply APY in a particular market.			</p>

						<p>
				Defi borrowers are often required to pay up to 200% of what they wish to borrow. Despite this over-collateralization, if the collateral's value begins to since, the lending pool will automatically use a circuit breaker and start liquidating the collateral to pay off the loan.			</p>

				In line with the interest rate decline, rates for borrowing money through DeFi platforms are also trending down a bit.

Interest rates start from around 0.03% and rise in some cases to over 50% APY.			</p>

				DeFi lending interest rates vary depending on the lending platforms, amounts, and the terms and conditions of the loan. DeFi lending platforms offer either fixed or floating interest rates.
