				Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system removes the control banks and institutions...			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi (or "decentralized finance") is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more — but it's faster and doesn't require paperwork or a third party.			</p>

						<p>
				A DeFi platform offers the user more than owning crypto coins. Users can lend and borrow crypto, take ownership of NFTs and take advantage of many opportunities provided by programmable smart ...			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi is an open and global financial system built for the internet age - an alternative to a system that's opaque, tightly controlled, and held together by decades-old infrastructure and processes. It gives you control and visibility over your money. It gives you exposure to global markets and alternatives to your local currency or banking options.			</p>

						<p>
				This decentralization doesn't just come out of anywhere, though - instead, DeFi is closely related to cryptocurrencies, or rather, the blockchain technology behind crypto. Blockchains are, primarily, decentralized. Yes, there are exceptions, but for the sake of keeping things simple and confusion-free, let's paint some things with a broad brush.			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralized finance, or "DeFi," is an umbrella term for the ecosystem of applications working toward the decentralization of finances.

						<p>
				Decentralized finance (DeFi) refers to websites that offer "decentralized" financial tools and services such as investing, borrowing, lending, trading, tokenized real estate and insurance.			</p>

						<p>
				A DeFi platform is an application that has made DeFi tools available in user-friendly ways. These tools are the lending, borrowing, staking, liquidity providing, and yield farming mentioned above. Not all blockchain protocols have the same DeFi opportunities. For example, you will be hard-pressed to find the same DeFi functionality on the ...			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi, short for decentralized finance, is the foundation for a new, open financial system that gives people more control of their finances and reduces dependence on large financial institutions. A few popular categories include cryptocurrency exchanges, lending platforms, wallets, and stablecoins.			</p>

						<p>
				In practice, DeFi is a network of DApps (decentralized applications) and smart contracts built on Ethereum blockchain that focuses on financial applications such as loans, derivatives, exchanges, trading, and more. DeFi focuses on the concept of "Lego" money. That is, the idea is for anyone to be able What is DeFi and How Does it Work?			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi lending is collateral-based, meaning in order to take out a loan, a user needs to put up collateral - often ether, the token that powers Ethereum. That means users don't give out their...			</p>

						<p>
				Simply put, DeFi is the crypto version of the finance industry. As the name suggests, it is completely decentralized.

It is worth noting here that DeFi is a concept.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi refers to financial services built on the blockchain, mainly on the Ethereum network, that allows anyone to access financial products and services online in a decentralized and borderless manner. Today, DeFi users can borrow, lend, trade, invest, and make payments without the need for a financial institution as an intermediary.			</p>

						<p>
				In simple terms, DeFi or Decentralised Finance can be defined as a merger of traditional banking services with blockchain technology. It replaces some components of the traditional financial system with smart contracts on a blockchain. Thus, DeFi offers financial services carried out on a blockchain (the most common blockchain used is Ethereum).			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi, short for decentralized finance, is a global, peer-to-peer system of storing and transferring assets without the structure, restriction and costs of a traditional centralized banking system.			</p>
