I've heard that SBE steals code from other mods. Is this true?
        </h2>
        <p class="mt-5 text-left text-2xl leading-15 text-white whitespace-pre-wrap">This is 100% not true. Skyblock Extras has not stolen code from any other mods.
List of Mods which SBE is often accused of stealing code from, as well as why it is not true:
 - DSM: Skyblock Extras implemented the TicTacToe solver based on: <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/minimax-algorithm-in-game-theory-set-3-tic-tac-toe-ai-finding-optimal-move/"target="_blank"><span class="text-blue-200">This Site</span></a>. DSM most likely used the same site.
 - SBC: SBC is MIT Licensed. Additionally, the SBE and SBC cosmetic code and regex pattern are different, and the acquirement method for each cosmetic is different as well.
 - Patcher: The Constant Values used in SBE and Patcher are the same, as they were taken directly from the newer versions of the game, as partially seen here: <a href="https://i.imgur.com/6lMa9Ge.png"target="_blank"><span class="text-blue-200">https://i.imgur.com/6lMa9Ge.png</span></a>. Therefore, they look very similar when compared. Other than this, SBE and Patcher have no code in common.
 - NEU: The Custom Skull re-texturing from NEU and SBE are different features. The NEU feature allows resource pack makers to change the skull in texture packs (custom models), while the SBE feature changes the texture entirely, similar to the armor color feature.
 - Crash Debugging: There is only 1 way to implement a custom crash message (using specific Mixin injections) while also preserving stacktrace. Since when was providing additional crash information frowned upon?

			Is SBE Against the EULA?
	    </h2>
        <p class="mt-5 text-left text-2xl leading-15 text-white whitespace-normal">
There is a section <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula#:~:text=you%20can%20do%20whatever%20you%20want%20with%20them,%20as%20long%20as%20you%20don't%20sell%20them%20for%20money%20/%20try%20to%20make%20money%20from%20them"target="_blank"><span class="text-blue-200">HERE</span></a>, 
which is the only section in the EULA and legal documents to imply that selling mods is prohibited. 
However, in this section, note that they say <span class="text-red-200">"as long as you don't sell them for money / try to make money from them and so long as you don’t distribute Modded Versions of the Game"</span>. <span class="font-bold">Other modifications, including Lunar Client, Badlion Client, and other cosmetic mods that sell cloaks and similar items, also try to make money. However, since it is fine for them to do so, this should apply to SBE as well.</span></p>
		<p class="mt-2 text-left text-2xl leading-15 text-white whitespace-normal">
The only other sections in the Minecraft EULA and Legal Documents which mention mods are: <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/minecraft_eula#:~:text=ONE%20MAJOR%20RULE"target="_blank"><span class="text-blue-200">HERE</span></a>, and <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/commercial_guidelines#:~:text=You%20may%20make%20money%20from%20Mods%20as%20described%20below%20in%20the%20section,%20%22Servers%20and%20Hosting.%22"target="_blank"><span class="text-blue-200">HERE</span></a>. 
In neither of these sections is it ever stated that selling user-created mods is prohibited. Mojang's copyright over Minecraft extends to "the Minecraft Name, Brand, and Assets, including software, graphics and audio". This does not include user-developed software (mods), as they do not contain a substantial part of the Minecraft code.
In fact, it is stated throughout the EULA and <a href="https://account.mojang.com/documents/commercial_guidelines"target="_blank"><span class="text-blue-200">Commercial Guidelines</span></a> that Mojang wishes to give creators and players a large degree of freedom in what they do.
Additionally, the header of the Commercial Guidelines states: 
        </p>
        <code class="mt-10 text-left bg-gray-700 text-xl leading-15 text-white whitespace-normal">
The Minecraft EULA and Brand and Asset Usage Guidelines ("Policies") restrict the commercial use of the Minecraft Name, Brand, and Assets, including software, graphics and audio.
However, since we do love the idea of players and fans doing cool things and sharing them with the community, and we realize that sometimes you need to charge to cover your costs, the following explains what we (currently) consider to be commercial use / commercial things. This may change as time goes by but for now, we hope that it helps you understand what you can and can’t do, and helps Minecraft fans do more (and limit those that try to go too far).
We have therefore drafted these Guidelines to allow some leniency with respect to limited commercial activity as outlined below.        
        </code>
        <p class="mt-5 text-left text-2xl leading-15 text-white whitespace-normal">
In other words, the Commercial Guidelines take priority over the EULA, and specify allowed commercial activities, of which selling mods is allowed.
