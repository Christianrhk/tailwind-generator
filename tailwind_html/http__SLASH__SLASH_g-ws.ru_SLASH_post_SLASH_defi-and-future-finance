				In DeFi and the Future of Finance, Campbell R. Harvey, Ashwin Ramachandran and Joey Santoro, introduce the new world of Decen­tralized Finance. The book argues that the current financial landscape is ripe for dis­ruption and we are seeing, in real time, the reinvention of finance.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi offers solution to five key problems—centralized control, limited access, inefficiency, lack of interoperability, and opacity—that arise from the current system of centralized finance. Decentralized finance offers new opportunities. The technology is nascent but the upside is promising.			</p>

						<p>
				We argue those initiatives that use decentralized methods - in particular blockchain technology - have the best chance to define the future of finance. This is an excerpt from a early version of our manuscript, DeFi and the Future of Finance published by John Wiley and Sons. It includes drafts of chapters 1, 2, 7 and 8 plus the DeFi glossary.			</p>

				Ideally suited for people working in any part of the finance industry as well as finan­cial policy makers, DeFi and the Future of Finance gives readers a vision of the future. The world of finance will fundamentally be changed over the coming decade. The book enables you to become part of the disruption - not the target of the disruption. Read more			</p>

				DeFi is about reducing financial frictions and making finance more inclusive. It enables economic growth. Benefits DeFi offers three significant benefits. Firstly, the algorithms or smart contracts at the heart of DeFi do not carry the baggage of traditional finance - there are no layers of bureaucracy and back office staff.			</p>

						<p>
				Given it costs no more to provide services to a customer with $100 or $100 million in assets, we believe that DeFi will replace all meaningful centralized financial infrastructure in the future. This is a technology of inclusion whereby anyone can pay the flat fee to use and benefit from the innovations of DeFi.			</p>

				DeFi and the Future of Finance is a set of four courses that focus on decentralized finance. The second course is called DeFi Primitives. It is recommended that you take the first course, DeFi Infrastructure, before this course. In this course, we talk about transaction mechanics and introduce both fungible and non-fungible tokens - or NFTs.			</p>

				Description DeFi and the Future of Finance is a set of four courses that focus on decentralized finance. In the first course in the series, DeFi Infrastructure, we begin by exploring the origins of DeFi and take a broad historical view from the earliest barter economies to present day. Indeed, barter was the first example of peer-to-peer exchange.			</p>

				106 1. DeFi is a rapidly growing blockchain sector with enormous potential. Decentralization technologies have the potential to totally transform the financial system, making it safer, more open, and less expensive for end-users. Every year, more and more people learn about how much better decentralized platforms are than centralized ones.			</p>

						<p>
				Stable coins that track the value of fiat currencies, such as the US Dollar, also experienced tremendous growth in the DeFi ecosystem. The market cap of USDC - a popular stable coin in DeFi - went from less than $1B in April 2020 to over $6B in 2021. Another one - DAI - went from less than $100M in April 2020 to almost $2B in 2021.			</p>

				The most likely future will involve some form of hybrid finances, in which some DeFi services merge with traditional finance. Already, solutions have launched to allow users to place some of their retirement investments into digital currencies and have some of their savings accounts in crypto, according to Wang.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi has manifested tremendous growth in the year of 2021. As of January 15, 2022, the total value locked in the DeFi space was approx $237 billion, growing by a staggering 1,266% from the January 1, 2021 figure of $18.71 billion.
