				Coinbase Announces DeFi Price Oracle By Lucas Campbell April 23, 2020 With DeFi nearing $1B in value locked for the second time this year, the reliance on secure price oracles continues to grow rapidly. Oracles act as a vital backbone for DeFi as it allows protocols to function properly by being able to reference asset prices in real-time.			</p>

						<p>
				The Coinbase price oracle provides a critically important service to the DeFi ecosystem: a signed price feed available via the Coinbase Pro API. By Andrei Anisimov and Luke Youngblood Over the last two years the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) ecosystem has rapidly expanded as a core use-case in crypto.			</p>

						<p>
				March 31, 2020 DeFi stands for Decentralized Finance. It's a new way of thinking when it comes to borrowing and lending money. And Coinbase -- one of the world's best cryptocurrency exchanges -- recently integrated DeFi directly into the wallet app which customers use. In this same article, Coinbase also defined what DeFi is:			</p>

						<p>
				Coinbase is making DeFi more customer friendly and accessible. Eligible users will now be able to access the attractive yields of DeFi from the comfort of their Coinbase account with just a few taps and without the network fees. Starting today, you'll be able to earn DeFi yield on Dai, a stablecoin that is designed to be pegged to the US Dollar.			</p>

						<p>
				So, it is fair to say that a DeFi protocol that has operated for over a year and has over $1B of total value locked in the protocol probably has less software risk than a DeFi protocol that launched two months ago and has $100M of total value locked in the protocol.			</p>

						<p>
				BAL rose 0.14% following the Coinbase listing, from $13.54 to $13.96, per data metrics site CoinMarketCap. Its overall daily trading volume increased by $5 million, from $58 billion to $63 billion. But in the past 24 hours, however, BAL's price dropped by 8%, from $15.			</p>

						<p>
				Many DeFi apps use price feeds that are available on-chain. This project aims to provide signed price data feeds from Coinbase for specific trading pairs. By signing the price data with an Ethereum private key controlled by Coinbase, DeFi app developers can trust this price feed to provide the most accurate source of on-chain price data.			</p>

						<p>
				It's unarguable that Coinbase has faced serious headwinds over the months amid the downtrend in the digital currency market. The company's valuation drastically dropped following the stock (COIN) price crash. On the 11th of May, Coinbase reported a net loss of $430 million in the first quarter of 2022.			</p>

						<p>
				Coinbase has hinted towards decentralized finance (DeFi) apps integration on its platform. The crypto exchange had previously made its interest in the space known and has provided support for various DeFi protocol tokens in the past. However, this would be the first time that the exchange is definitely looking into bringing decentralized ...			</p>

						<p>
				Over the weekend, Bitcoin price fell below the psychological $20,000 barrier. On Saturday, it fell to a low of $17,599, until it started to recover to around $20,000 on Sunday. On Monday and ...			</p>

						<p>
				The Coinbase Oracle is intended to help make the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem safer by providing a secure, trusted source of price information to help reduce reliance on signed price data from less liquid exchanges or on-chain data from decentralized exchanges, both of which are susceptible to attacks by bad actors.			</p>

						<p>
				The live MRHB DeFi price today is $0.011445 USD with a 24-hour trading volume of $867,864 USD. We update our MRHB to USD price in real-time. MRHB DeFi is down 2.94% in the last 24 hours. The current CoinMarketCap ranking is #3036, with a live market cap of not available.			</p>

						<p>
				The major crypto exchange Coinbase has announced to introduce a DeFi price oracle which will give a key service to the DeFi ecosystem. The Coinbase price oracle is a signed price feed and is sourced from the Coinbase Pro exchange. This newly introduced feature will allow anyone to publish data on-chain.			</p>

						<p>
				It is currently trading at $34,271. YFI, the governance token that powers yield aggregator platform yearn.finance, will be listed on Coinbase Pro on September 14, the Californian crypto exchange announced today. Monday's launch will mark the latest DeFi governance coin Coinbase has added to its exchange.			</p>

				LBLOCK coin price chart. Being an early investor in DeFi projects provides the best return on investment (ROI) in the long-term - LBLOCK tops our ranking as the best DeFi coin to buy since it ...			</p>

				DFI.money (YFII) $378.83 Sushi (SUSHI) $1.15 Balancer (BAL) $5.89 THORChain (RUNE) $2.37 Reserve Rights (RSR) $0.007176 Ampleforth (AMPL) $0.951819 Nest Protocol (NEST) $0.029780 Serum (SRM) $0.943800 Keep Network (KEEP) $0.218614 Augur (REP) $7.89 Curve DAO (CRV) $0.881938 Kava (KAVA) $2.01 Bancor Network (BNT) $1.07 JUST (JST) $0.038249			</p>

						<p>
				Claim validity is determined by mutual members, and they use a pooled-capital model for up to 10x capital efficiency. This model clearly works, and they carry the most coverage in DeFi today with $500M in TVL underwriting $900M in coverage, but still pales in comparison to the $50B+ locked in DeFi today.			</p>

				DeFi Meet the Coinbase Price Oracle: BTC & ETH Price Feeds for DeFi On Thursday, April 23rd, the San Francisco-based crypto exchange announced the launch of the Coinbase Price Oracle, which will allow anyone or any project to retrieve signed price data via an API By William M. Peaster April 24, 2020			</p>
