<p data-block-key="vkuhw">In this article, we are going to share 20 great small business ideas you can start today with under Ksh 50,000. For each idea, we try to highlight why we think it is a good choice to venture in.</p><h2 data-block-key="mspva">Fumigation and pest control</h2><img alt="fumigation.jpeg" class="richtext-image full-width" height="407" src="https://website-assets.intasend.com/images/fumigation.width-800.jpg" width="407"><p data-block-key="56icj">Fumigation and pest control come at the top of the list because we have few people doing it and the demand is on the rise. The idea is to offer home service and professionally help your client to eradicate pests like cockroaches, mosquitoes, and bugs. You can combine this business with the home cleaning, where you offer a full home fix. Cleaning service can be seated scrubbing, carpet cleaning, wall scrubbing, etc. You might need a partner to start since it is labor-intensive. Invest in affordable fumigation protective gear that would cost KES 20,000 to 30,000. Exercise professionalism and safety at all costs. Marketing can be done through social media and referrals. Your idea customers will be homes, business offices, warehouses, and schools.</p><h2 data-block-key="0so29"><b>Food delivery</b></h2><p data-block-key="6mlfh"></p><img alt="salmon-518032_640.original.jpg" class="richtext-image full-width" height="480" src="https://website-assets.intasend.com/images/salmon-518032_640.original.width-800.jpg" width="640"><p data-block-key="zufep"></p><p data-block-key="r0dxv">Food delivery is a great idea that seems to stay lucrative for a long time.
