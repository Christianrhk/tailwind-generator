	<div><h2>UGA Mission Statement</h2>
<p>The Utah Genealogical Association provides genealogical information, sources and education through personal instruction and published media on state, national and international family history topics, while promoting high standards and ethical practices.</p>
<h2>UGA Information</h2>
<p>The Utah Genealogical Association was formally organized on September 25, 1971, and chartered on December 1, 1971, by the State of Utah as a nonprofit educational organization. The Association&#39;s interests are worldwide while still providing specific materials of interest relating to Utah. It is not affiliated with any religious or political organization.</p>
<p>The Association is governed by an Executive Committee comprised of the President, 1st Vice-President, and 2nd Vice-President plus a Board of Governors. Members of the Board are elected by the general membership of the Association and serve for a period of three years.</p>
<p>In addition, dozens of volunteers serve on various committees, staff booths at conferences, and work behind the scenes to assure the membership a vibrant, collegial, and enjoyable Association.</p>
<p>The Association publishes <strong><em>Crossroads</em></strong>, a quarterly journal of general interest in the field of genealogy and family history. The journal is sent to the general membership of the Association and is also available to the membership in an electronic edition on this website.</p>
<p>Association members can share information on specific surnames through our Surname Research page. We sponsor an annual meeting wherein outstanding service and accomplishments are recognized and awarded.</p>
<p>Also available to members is the opportunity to participate in a monthly &quot;virtual chapter&quot; meeting wherein experts in various aspects of genealogy and family history make hour-long presentations on their areas of expertise. These presentations are then archived for member review and access at any time.</p>
<h2>UGA By-Laws</h2>
<p>The latest revision of the <a href="/upload/files/UGA_Bylaws_with_proposed_changes_4-13-2019(1).pdf" target="_blank">Utah Genealogical Association ByLaws</a> was approved on 13 April 2019, drafted by an ad-hoc Bylaws Committee made up of UGA Board members.</p></div>

	<div><h2>Bonnie Andersen
</h2>
<p><img alt="Bonnie Andersen" class="profilePhoto" src="/upload/images/board-of-directors/bonnie_andersen-thumbnail.jpg" /> My name is Bonnie Andersen. I live in Lehi, Utah. I am currently attending Salt Lake Community College and am in the last semester of the Genealogy International Track. I previously took classes in Genetic Genealogy and received my certificate in U.S. Research. As a single young woman, I attended Brigham Young University, 1979-1982.
</p>
<p>At the age of thirty-six, I found my birth mother. The next year I found my birth father. From that point on I have dug into as many records about my biological family as my shovel can scrape up. I have written generational research reports about some of them and still have many to finish. There have been so many miracles connected to this research.
</p>
<p>For the past four years, I have been focusing my research in the Upper Midwest area of the U.S and in Canada. I would feel comfortable researching in any of the states and in several European countries. I know a wee bit of French and Spanish, and have lived in Portugal and Saudi Arabia.
</p>
<p>At Salt Lake Community College, I have received A&rsquo;s in all of my courses. I have so enjoyed learning from some of the best teachers around.
</p>
<p>I feel that through my studies and training I could be an asset to others. I feel that through the personal research I have done as well as helping others to do their own research, I can move through a report with skill.
</p>
<p>I am eager to help the Utah Genealogical Association with anything that I am able to do.
