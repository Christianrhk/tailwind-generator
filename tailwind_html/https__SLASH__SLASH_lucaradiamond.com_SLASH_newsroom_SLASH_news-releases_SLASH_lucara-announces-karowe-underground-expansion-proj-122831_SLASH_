The project is fully financed, allowing us to move into high gear during the second half of the year. Using conservative diamond price assumptions, the project delivers strong economics projected to pay back capital in under three years and add approximately <span class="xn-money">$4 billion</span> in revenues from an extended mine life out to at least 2040. The project also comes at a time when the outlook for the diamond market is stronger than it has been for many years representing an exciting growth opportunity for our shareholders and stakeholders in <span class="xn-location">Botswana</span>."</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic has impacted the UGP project schedule, however, no material variances between the 2019 FS (<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=531418743&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Flucara-announces-positive-feasibility-study-for-ka-122784%2F&amp;a=link+to+news+release" rel="nofollow">link to news release</a>) and the current execution plan have resulted. Rather, during this period in 2020 and 2021, all critical path items were addressed and a concerted effort was placed on detailed design, engineering and procurement which have helped to significantly de-risk the project. Out of the total capital budget, the Company has spent <span class="xn-money">$51.4 million</span> on project execution activities through 2020 until the end of <span class="xn-chron">June 2021</span>, including shaft and geotechnical engineering, procurement of long lead time and essential shaft sinking items, surface infrastructure and construction activities, bulk power supply power line engineering and procurement. Mobilization of the shaft pre-sink team commenced in late Q2 2021 with shaft pre-sinking on track to commence in mid Q3 2021. Open pit mining operations have been adjusted to limit the risk of production shortfalls during the ramp up of the Underground mine operations commencing in H1 2026. The budgeted spend on underground expansion activities in 2021 is up to <span class="xn-money">$120 million</span>.</p><p>Please refer to the aerial images of the UG expansion project area (<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=4168547470&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fsite%2Fassets%2Ffiles%2F11413%2F2021-08-11_karowe_ugp_aerial_images.pdf&amp;a=image+attached" rel="nofollow">image attached</a>) for an overview of the site general arrangement and construction activity to early <span class="xn-chron">June 2021</span>.</p><p><b>Mining Method</b></p><p>The Karowe Mine is an existing conventional drill and blast open pit operation, with diesel excavators and trucks providing an average annual 2.6 million tonnes of kimberlite feed to the mill. The open pit mine operation is expected to terminate mid-2026, ending at an elevation of approximately 700 metres above sea level ("masl").</p><p>The Karowe UGP is targeting the substantial resources remaining below the economic extents of the open pit in the South Lobe. A 7,200 tonne per day shaft operation utilizing long hole shrinkage ("LHS") mining will provide an additional 13 years of mine life to the Karowe operation after a five year construction period. The mine will be accessed from a 767 metre deep production shaft, 8.5 metres in diameter, driven from surface and will be equipped with two 21- tonne skips for production hoisting and a service cage for man and material movement through the mine. This shaft will also serve as the main fresh air intake to the mine. A second shaft, 6.0 metre in diameter, driven 733 metres deep from surface, will form the main ventilation exhaust pathway.</p><p>The LHS method is planned to systematically drill and blast the entire lobe on a vertical retreat basis. In LHS, a significant proportion of the blasted muck is left in the stope during blasting and stoping to stabilize the host rock with only the swell extracted during the drill and blast phase. Mucking will take place from draw points from the 310L (310 masl) extraction level. Once the column is fully blasted, the stope will be drawn empty by mucking the draw points. The bottom-up approach of the LHS mining method takes advantage of the higher value EM/PK(S) kimberlite unit at depth in the South Lobe at Karowe, and balances high initial capital costs with low operating costs while de-risking the project with respect to the geotechnical and hydrogeological aspects of the host rocks.</p><p><b>LHS Benefits: Early Access to High Value EM/PK(S) Feed</b></p><p>Selection of the LHS mining method brings several advantages during the first years of underground operations at Karowe, namely: i) access to the highest value portion of the lower South Lobe, ii) minimal dilution as mining occurs in competent granite host rock, and iii) underground development can be done simultaneously with open pit operations. Volumetrically the EM/PK(S) unit forms the dominant rock type that will be extracted during the early stage of the underground operations. Over 90% of the recoverable carats between the 310 and 400 levels are attributable to the EM/PK(S) which has a demonstrably coarse diamond size frequency distribution and is a significant source of large high value diamonds from current open pit operations.</p><p>Karowe has produced 3 diamonds in excess of 1,000 carats, each of which has been recovered from processing of the EM/PK(S) kimberlite (1,109 carat <span class="xn-person">Lesedi La Rona</span>, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=1658205058&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Flucara-makes-diamond-history-recovers-1-111-carat-diamond-122558%2F&amp;a=Nov.+2015" rel="nofollow"><span class="xn-chron">Nov. 2015</span></a>; 1,758 carat Sewelô, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=1565393558&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Flucara-recovers-record-1-758-carat-diamond-from-karowe-122771%2F&amp;a=April+2019" rel="nofollow"><span class="xn-chron">April 2019</span></a>; 1,174 carat <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=2776140987&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Flucara-recovers-1-174-carat-diamond-from-the-karow-122821%2F&amp;a=June+2021" rel="nofollow"><span class="xn-chron">June 2021</span></a>) in addition to top white gem diamonds (549 carat Sethunya, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=1138477624&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Flucara-recovers-exceptional-549-carat-white-gem-di-122788%2F&amp;a=Feb+2020" rel="nofollow"><span class="xn-chron">Feb 2020</span></a>, 813 carat Constellation, <a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=967690353&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Flucara-recovers-two-more-large-diamonds-including-an-813-carat-stone-from-the-karowe-mine-in-botswan-122557%2F&amp;a=Nov+2015" rel="nofollow"><span class="xn-chron">Nov 2015</span></a>).

The continued strong resource performance and recovery of large diamonds reinforces the significance of the EM/PK(S) as an important economic driver for the underground mine at Karowe.</p><p><b>Cost and Schedule Update</b></p><p>A revised project cost and schedule has been developed that captures the detailed engineering and design work through 2020 until <span class="xn-chron">May 2021</span>, incorporating all changes, improvements, and COVID-19 related delays. Overall capital expenditures, including contingency have increased marginally by approximately 4%, to <span class="xn-money">$534 million</span>, driven by the increase to the production shaft diameter and additional mine development (see "<i>Shaft and Mining</i>" below). Through 2020 to the end of Q2 2021, the Company has spent <span class="xn-money">$51.4 million</span> of the total budget (Table 1) on project execution activities.  Total expenditures on the UGP in 2021 are expected to be up to <span class="xn-money">$120 million</span>. The schedule to 75% of full production has increased by 1.3 years, driven mainly by COVID-19 related delays to commence the shaft pre-sinking, and additional planned time for shaft station break-outs and ground support. The open pit mining schedule has been adjusted to push the open pit to 2026, with mill throughput maintained at 2.6 million tonnes per annum. Underground operation parameters with respect to waste and ore tonnes mined, processed tonnes, recoverable diamond grade, recovered carats and diamond pricing assumptions are unchanged from the 2019 FS study.   </p><p><b>Table 1 – Comparison of 2019 FS vs 2021 Base Plan</b></p><div><table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="1" class="prntblns"><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen4"><br /></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen5"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span"><b>2019 FS</b></span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen5"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span"><b>2021 Base Case</b></span></p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen6"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Capital Costs</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Pre-Production<br />($ million)</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Pre-Production<br />($ million)</span></p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen6"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Mining</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">321.7</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">309.4</span></p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen6"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Bulk Earthworks</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">18.98</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">18.1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen6"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Process Plant</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">0.1</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">0.1</span></p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen6"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Onsite Infrastructure</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">5.9</span></p></td><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen7"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">13.2</span></p></td></tr><tr><td nowrap="nowrap" class="prngen6"><p class="prnews_p"><span class="prnews_span">Buildings &amp;

Hoist houses, hoist foundations and shaft collars are now well advanced and on time for commencement of pre-sinking which is planned during Q3 2021. To date, over 430 days have been worked LTI-free, on the project. As construction and mining activities ramp up, focused attention will continue to be paid on the continuation of safe operations.</p><p><i>Temporary Power Generation<br /></i>Temporary power for shaft sinking is required until such time as the upgrade bulk power supply infrastructure is commissioned in Q4 2022. A three phased ramp up of the generator capacity is planned to support the increasing power requirements related to the shaft sinking activities. A power supply and services contract for the temporary generators has been signed with Aggreko International Projects Limited. Mobilization has been initiated with the generator pad established. Commissioning of Phase 1 is scheduled during Q3 2021 to support the start of pre-sink activities.</p><p><i>Bulk Power Supply<br /></i>During 2020, Lucara negotiated and signed a self-build agreement with the Botswana Power Corporation ("BPC") for the construction of two substations and a 29km long 132kv Transmission line from BPC's newly established Letlhakane substation to the Karowe mine. The planned route follows an existing regional 400kV line and then runs parallel to the existing 11kV transmission line currently supplying bulk power to the Karowe mine. The new power infrastructure will provide the required power for the current open pit, processing plant and the underground mine expansion. Commissioning of and handover to BPC is scheduled for Q4 2022. Construction of substations is scheduled to commence in Q3 2021 and power line construction in Q1 2022.</p><p><i>Camp Construction<br /></i>A 200-person camp is required to support shaft sinking and underground mine development. The camp is contiguous with and within the Karowe Mine lease. Camp construction has been separated into two 100-person phases, construction of Phase 1 is complete with commissioning and occupation in <span class="xn-chron">July 2021</span>. Phase 2 of the camp will commence construction during Q3 2021, in line with the project schedule.</p><p><b>Procurement</b></p><p>Procurement of long lead items required for shaft sinking and for the bulk power supply are advancing on schedule. Main sinking shaft hoist refurbishment is well underway with packing and shipping commenced for various components. In the process of completion for the hoists are electrical components and the production shaft kibble hoist's gearbox currently in fabrication. All hoist components are estimated for completion in Q4 2021.</p><p><b>Shafts and Mining</b></p><p>Access to the underground mine is via two vertical shafts, the production and ventilation shafts. The shafts will be concrete lined with the production shaft acting as the main air intake and the ventilation shaft as the exhaust. Detailed design and engineering work on the production and ventilation shafts is now 90% complete, and has resulted in the following changes to the 2019 FS: i) production shaft diameter has increased from 8.0 metres to 8.5 metres, ii) ventilation shaft permanent headframe, hoists and internal conveyances have been removed, iii) parallel pre-sinking of both shafts, iv) ventilation fans and coolers to be located on surface, v) in shaft grouting of water strikes changed from grout curtain installation from surface, vi) planned development of an additional sublevel to assist in drilling of drawbells, vii) removal of 670L de-watering galleries.</p><p>The number of shaft stations and nominal elevations remains the same as the 2019 FS. The planned depth of the production shaft remains at approximately 767 metres (245masl), but final planned depth of the ventilation shaft has increased marginally to 733 metres (285masl) from 716 metres.</p><p>Increased schedule time related to shaft sinking has been a result of the following design changes: i) increased production shaft diameter, ii) time allowances for in shaft grouting during sinking operations planned at known water strike horizons, iii) holing through all shaft stations between shafts, iv) additional ground support for underground stations/level breakouts.</p><p>Pre-sink construction contract and shaft sinking equipment procurement were awarded to UMS Botswana and UMS South Africa respectively ("UMS"). METS International Limited, a subsidiary of UMS, was awarded the shaft engineering contract.  UMS is in the process of mobilizing crews to Karowe to initiate pre-sink works. Pre-sinking of the two shafts will run in parallel and start with mobile cranes and then transition to <span class="xn-person">Scott Derrick</span> cranes with the final depth of pre-sink at approximately 40 metres below surface (971 masl).</p><p>With the exception of an additional sublevel (340L) to assist with drill and blast of drawbells, the design, layout and infrastructure of the underground mine all remain aligned with the 2019 FS. Detailed engineering and design of the underground infrastructure and layouts will commence in Q3 2021 and are expected to be competed in Q3 2022, with no major changes from the 2019 FS plan anticipated. Underground mine development is scheduled to commence in H2 2024 with underground production ramp up starting in 2026. Full production is scheduled for the end of 2026.</p><p><b>Permitting</b></p><p>In <span class="xn-chron">January 2021</span>, Lucara announced that its application for the renewal of Mining License No 2008/6L in respect of the Karowe Mine had been approved by <span class="xn-location">Botswana's</span> Minister of Mineral Resources, Green Technology and Energy Security (<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=242663472&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fnewsroom%2Fnews-releases%2Fkarowe-receives-mining-licence-renewal-and-extensi-122805%2F&amp;a=link+to+news+release" rel="nofollow">link to news release</a>).

The 2019 update also included geological information and production data derived from open pit mining to the end of <span class="xn-chron">June 2019</span>. Historic and current geological data was used to develop an updated internal geology model for the South Lobe and updates to the external contacts for the South, Centre and North Lobes.</p><p>The internal geology of the South Lobe is comprised of two dominant domains, identified as the M/PK(S) and EM/PK(S) domains. A single diamond size frequency distribution ("SFD") and diamond value model was used prior to 2019 to evaluate the South Lobe. Incremental open pit production of EM/PK(S) material was initiated in early 2018 and sufficient data has since been amassed so that distinct SFD and diamond value distribution models are now defined for both the M/PK(S) and EM/PK(S) domains in the 2019 Mineral Resource update.</p><p>The 2021 Mineral Resource update, effective <span class="xn-chron">December 25, 2020</span> (<a href="https://c212.net/c/link/?t=0&amp;l=en&amp;o=3255851-1&amp;h=2848656793&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Flucaradiamond.com%2Fsite%2Fassets%2Ffiles%2F62796%2Flucara_annual_information_form_2020_year_end_final.pdf&amp;a=Annual+Information+Form" rel="nofollow">Annual Information Form</a>), incorporates production since the 2019 Mineral Resource was completed.
