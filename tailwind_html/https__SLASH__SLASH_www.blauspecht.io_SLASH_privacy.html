</ul>
<p></p>
<p class="my-2">We may also disclose personal and non-personal information about you to government or law enforcement
    officials or private parties as we, in our sole discretion, believe necessary or appropriate in order to respond to
    claims, legal process (including subpoenas), to protect our rights and interests or those of a third party, the
    safety of the public or any person, to prevent or stop any illegal, unethical, or legally actionable activity, or to
    otherwise comply with applicable court orders, laws, rules and regulations.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Where and when is information collected from customers and end users?</h2>
<p class="my-2">Blauspecht will collect personal information that you submit to us. We may also receive personal
    information about
    you from third parties as described above.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">How Do We Use Your Email Address?</h2>
<p class="my-2">By submitting your email address on this website, you agree to receive emails from us. You can cancel
    your
    participation in any of these email lists at any time by clicking on the opt-out link or other unsubscribe option
    that is included in the respective email. We only send emails to people who have authorized us to contact them,
    either directly, or through a third party. We do not send unsolicited commercial emails, because we hate spam as
    much as you do.
    If at
    any time you would like to unsubscribe from receiving future emails, we include detailed unsubscribe instructions at
    the bottom of each email.<i> We will, however, still send you emails that are necessary to provide our service,
    related to your account, subscription, or in response to service requests</i></p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">How Long Do We Keep Your Information?</h2>
<p class="my-2">We keep your information only so long as we need it to provide our service to you and fulfill the
    purposes described
    in this policy. This is also the case for anyone that we share your information with and who carries out services on
    our behalf. When we no longer need to use your information and there is no need for us to keep it to comply with our
    legal or regulatory obligations, we’ll either remove it from our systems or depersonalize it so that we can't
    identify you.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">How Do We Protect Your Information?</h2>
<p class="my-2">We implement a variety of security measures to maintain the safety of your personal information when you
enter, submit, or access your personal information. All supplied
    personal, sensitive, payment, and credit information is transmitted via Transporter Layer Security (TLS) technology
    and then encrypted. We cannot, however,
    ensure or
    warrant the absolute security of any information you transmit to Blauspecht or guarantee that your information on
    the Service may not be accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by a breach of any of our physical, technical, or
    managerial safeguards.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Could my information be transferred to other countries?</h2>
<p class="my-2">Blauspecht is incorporated in Germany. <i>Our services maybe be hosted and your data may be stored
        solely in Germany and Finland. We do not transfer data to other countries unless we are required by by government or
        law enforcement
        officials as mentioned above.</i></p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Is the information collected through the Blauspecht Service secure?</h2>
<p class="my-2">We take precautions to protect the security of your information. We have physical, electronic, and
    managerial
    procedures to help safeguard, prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and correctly use your
    information. However, neither people nor security systems are foolproof, including encryption systems. In addition,
    people can commit intentional crimes, make mistakes or fail to follow policies. Therefore, while we use reasonable
    efforts to protect your personal information, we cannot guarantee its absolute security. If applicable law imposes
    any non-disclaimable duty to protect your personal information, you agree that intentional misconduct will be the
    standards used to measure our compliance with that duty.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Can I update or correct my information?</h2>
<p class="my-2">The rights you have to request updates or corrections to the information Blauspecht collects depend on
    your
    relationship with Blauspecht. Personnel may update or correct their information as detailed in our internal company
    employment policies.</p>
<p class="my-2">Customers have the right to request the restriction of certain uses and disclosures of personally
    identifiable
    information as follows. You can contact us in order to (1) update or correct your personally identifiable
    information, (2) change your preferences with respect to communications and other information you receive from us,
    or (3) delete the personally identifiable information maintained about you on our systems (subject to the following
    paragraph), by cancelling your account. Such updates, corrections, changes and deletions will have no effect on
    other information that we maintain, or information that we have provided to third parties in accordance with this
    Privacy Policy prior to such update, correction, change or deletion. To protect your privacy and security, we may
    take reasonable steps (such as <i>requesting a successful login via
        Twitter</i>)
    to verify your identity before granting you profile access or making corrections. You are responsible for
    maintaining
    <i>the security of your Twitter account</i> at all times.</p>
<p class="my-2">You should be aware that it is not technologically possible to remove each and every record of the
    information you
    have provided to us from our system. The need to back up our systems to protect information from inadvertent loss
    means that a copy of your information may exist in a non-erasable form that will be difficult or impossible for us
    to locate. Promptly after receiving your request, all personal information stored in databases we actively use, and
    other readily searchable media will be updated, corrected, changed or deleted, as appropriate, as soon as and to the
    extent reasonably and technically practicable.</p>
<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Sale of Business</h2>
<p class="my-2">We reserve the right to transfer information to a third party in the event of a sale, merger or other
    transfer of all
    or substantially all of the assets of Blauspecht or any of its Corporate Affiliates (as defined herein), or that
    portion of Blauspecht or any of its Corporate Affiliates to which the Service relates, or in the event that we
    discontinue our business or file a petition or have filed against us a petition in bankruptcy, reorganization or
    similar proceeding, provided that the third party agrees to adhere to the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Affiliates</h2>
<p class="my-2">We may disclose information (including personal information) about you to our Corporate Affiliates. For
    purposes of
    this Privacy Policy, "Corporate Affiliate" means any person or entity which directly or indirectly controls, is
    controlled by or is under common control with Blauspecht, whether by ownership or otherwise. Any information
    relating to you that we provide to our Corporate Affiliates will be treated by those Corporate Affiliates in
    accordance with the terms of this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Governing Law</h2>
<p class="my-2">This Privacy Policy is governed by the laws of DE without regard to its conflict of laws provision. You
    consent to
    the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in connection with any action or dispute arising between the parties under
    or in connection with this Privacy Policy except for those individuals who may have rights to make claims under

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Information about General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h2>
<p class="my-2">We may be collecting and using information from you if you are from the European Economic Area (EEA),
    and in this
    section of our Privacy Policy we are going to explain exactly how and why is this data collected, and how we
    maintain this data under protection from being replicated or used in the wrong way.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">What is GDPR?</h2>
<p class="my-2">GDPR is an EU-wide privacy and data protection law that regulates how EU residents' data is protected by
    companies
    and enhances the control the EU residents have, over their personal data.</p>
<p class="my-2">The GDPR is relevant to any globally operating company and not just the EU-based businesses and EU
    residents. Our
    customers’ data is important irrespective of where they are located, which is why we have implemented GDPR controls
    as our baseline standard for all our operations worldwide.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">What is personal data?</h2>
<p class="my-2">Any data that relates to an identifiable or identified individual. GDPR covers a broad spectrum of
    information that
    could be used on its own, or in combination with other pieces of information, to identify a person. Personal data
    extends beyond a person’s name or email address. Some examples include financial information, political opinions,
    genetic data, biometric data, IP addresses, physical address, sexual orientation, and ethnicity.</p>
<p class="my-2">The Data Protection Principles include requirements such as:</p>
<ul class="list-disc">
    <li class="my-2">Personal data collected must be processed in a fair, legal, and transparent way and should only be
        used in a way
        that a person would reasonably expect.</li>
    <li class="my-2">Personal data should only be collected to fulfil a specific purpose and it should only be used for
        that purpose.
        Organizations must specify why they need the personal data when they collect it.</li>
    <li class="my-2">Personal data should be held no longer than necessary to fulfil its purpose.</li>
    <li class="my-2">People covered by the GDPR have the right to access their own personal data. They can also request
        a copy of
        their data, and that their data be updated, deleted, restricted, or moved to another organization.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Why is GDPR important?</h2>
<p class="my-2">GDPR adds some new requirements regarding how companies should protect individuals' personal data that
    they collect
    and process. It also raises the stakes for compliance by increasing enforcement and imposing greater fines for
    breach. Beyond these facts it's simply the right thing to do. At Help Scout we strongly believe that your data
    privacy is very important and we already have solid security and privacy practices in place that go beyond the
    requirements of this new regulation.</p>

<h2 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Individual Data Subject's Rights - Data Access, Portability and Deletion</h2>
<p class="my-2">We are committed to helping our customers meet the data subject rights requirements of GDPR. Blauspecht
    processes or
    stores all personal data in fully vetted, DPA compliant vendors. We do store all conversation and personal data for
