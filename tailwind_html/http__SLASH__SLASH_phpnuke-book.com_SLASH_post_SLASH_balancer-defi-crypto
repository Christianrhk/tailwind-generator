				The Balancer Protocol is a core building block of DeFi infrastructure—a unique financial primitive and permissionless development platform. Balancer is the most flexible and versatile Automated Market Maker, giving developers unprecedented customizability. Custom token weights & swap fees Liquidity pools can operate on any price curve			</p>

						<p>
				Balancer derives its name from the formula it uses. As such, it essentially allows any number of tokens in any weights or trading fees into to its custom pools. The protocol is designed two...			</p>

				Balancer is a DeFi protocol based on Ethereum that allows for automatic market-making (AMM). Unlike a traditional market maker/liquidity provider which buys and sells financial instruments, an AMM is a market-making agent that is controlled by algorithms that define rules for trades. Other DeFi platforms like Uniswap and Curve also support AMM.			</p>

						<p>
				Balancer is a decentralized finance protocol based on Ethereum that allows for automatic market-making. More broadly, a traditional market maker/liquidity provider buys and sells financial instruments, providing liquidity to a market and profiting from the spread between the bid and ask prices.			</p>

						<p>
				Balancer is essentially an advanced automated market maker. As a result, it uses the ratio between assets shared in liquidity pools to determine each asset's value and keep them 'balanced'. As users add or remove liquidity from one side of a pool by conducting trades, this changes the pool ratio. Hence changing the value of each asset.			</p>

						<p>
				Balancer allows any token holder to provide liquidity with 100% of their assets by immediately turning their whole portfolio into a Balancer pool or adding it to existing pools. The pools allow up to 8 tokens with any custom distribution value for each. The deposited assets can earn from trades in the pool.			</p>

						<p>
				Balancer is an AMM, DEX, and liquidity pool protocol that can be used for swapping ERC-20 assets without needing to rely on any centralized entities. As a permissionless platform, anybody can access Balancer, so long as they have a supported wallet installed ( MetaMask, WalletConnect, Portis, Coinbase Wallet, or Fortmatic). Did you know?			</p>

				Balancer is an automated market maker protocol that enables users to seamlessly exchange Ethereum-based assets in a decentralized manner. In many ways, it functions in a similar way as Uniswap. However, Balancer's prime differentiating factor is that it supports as many as eight assets for each market. Also, the creator of the pool is allowed ...			</p>

				Balancer is a modern form of decentralized exchange, known as an automated market maker. This means it uses the ratio between assets shared in a liquidity pool to determine each asset's value. As users add or remove liquidity from one side of a pool by conducting trades, this changes the pool ratio, and hence the price of each asset.			</p>
