Some let you sign up for email alerts when there are discounts available.

For example, the Chase app offers a feature called "QuickDeposit," which allows you to deposit checks directly into your account by taking a picture of them with your phone. This can help you save time and money since you won't have to go to the bank to deposit the check.</p><p><br></p><p>Most FDIC-insured banks offer a debit card and a mobile banking app that interconnect your savings accounts and checking accounts, making it easy to track your spending habits, transfer money among the different bank accounts you keep with them, and withdraw money if needed.</p><p><br></p><p>A word of caution with your debit card. Frank William Abagnale Jr. is a convicted fraudster and banking scam specialist who has repeatedly said that we should never use a debit card. His exact words were: "A debit card is certainly and truly the worst financial tool ever given to the American consumer."</p><p><br></p><p>He believes that this type of plastic payment device is dangerous because criminals can easily withdraw large sums of money from ATMs without having to provide any identification.</p><p><br></p><p>According to Mr. Abagnale, using credit cards instead of debit cards makes it more difficult for criminals to steal your money. However, many people continue to spend money using their debit cards every day without incident.</p><p><br></p><h2>Your existing Savings Account</h2><p>While the interest rates on savings accounts have been disappointing, some banks still offer some attractive rates on savings accounts. One of the most attractive is the savings account of Capital One,&nbsp;Member FDIC.</p><p><br></p><p>Capital One 360 Performance Savings Account has some of the most attractive savings account rates available, especially if you can stash away a significant amount. Capital One 360 offers a 0.40% Annual Percentage Yield (APY) earned over the average daily balance in the account, which contrasts with the average national rate for savings accounts of only 0.06% Annual Percentage Yield (APY).</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1649034694_Yourexistingcheckingaccountandsavingsaccount.webp"></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Emergency Fund</strong></p><p>Creating a rainy day fund will be one of the most important financial decisions you would have ever made.</p><p><br></p><p>Being unable to afford an emergency is one feeling that many people deal with regularly. Whether it's car accidents, medical emergencies, or natural disasters.</p><p><br></p><p>These unexpected costs can put pressure on your finances and make you worry about how things will go financially from here on out for weeks until payday arrives again, just like every other week before this happened!</p><p><br></p><p>To <a href="https://www.ivanremus.com/articles/personal-finances/how-to-create-an-emergency-fund" target="_blank">create an emergency fund</a>, you can, with minimal effort, save more money by establishing automatic savings transfers from your checking account to your savings account at the time you receive your direct deposit.</p><p><br></p><p>The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau recommends that, besides creating an emergency fund, you should take the time to document your financial information and contact numbers before a disaster or emergency arises.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Your Credit Card</strong></p><p>The <a href="https://geni.us/DAJvtqR" target="_blank">credit card</a> is more than just for your finances. Nowadays, many cards offer various services to help you keep track of financial health by telling how much money goes into different areas in life and what's being spent on each one- colored indicators if it’s an expense category like groceries or gas!</p><p>The best part? You can get all this fancy information without installing extra apps onto phones; everything will be at hand through online billing statements delivered straightaway when logging into your online banks, making informed financial decisions easier than ever!</p><p><br></p><h2>Final thoughts on the Best Money-Saving App</h2><p>Saving money doesn't have to be difficult. These money-saving apps make it easy to save money on your next purchase. But using apps that help you have some extra cash for your disposal is just one part of the equation.</p><p><br></p><p>You must find ways to create and consistently contribute to your retirement account to achieve your financial goals.
