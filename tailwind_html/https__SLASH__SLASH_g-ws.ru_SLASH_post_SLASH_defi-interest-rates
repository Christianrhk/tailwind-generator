				Current Rates 30 Day AVG Crypto lending rates are updated every hour. Decentralized Finance lending - or DeFi lending for short - allows users to supply cryptocurrencies in exchange for earning an annualized return. Welcome to the DeFi Rate lending page - your guide to real-time interest rates across all the most popular platforms in DeFi.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi Swap currently offers users four core plans with amazing APYs to back them up: Bronze - 30 Days - 30% APY Silver - 90 Days - 45% APY Gold - 180 Days - 60% APY Platinum - 365 Days - 75% APY...			</p>

				Here are the latest DeFi interest rates from the most established DeFi lending and savings platforms, compared with the average interest rates from traditional banks. Leading DeFi Lending and Savings Apps We track the best interest rates paid to depositors at five leading DeFi protocols.			</p>

						<p>
				Assets are automatically shifted between lending platforms in the DeFi ecosystem like Compound and Aave, where interest rates for deposited assets change dynamically. Every time a new user deposits...			</p>

						<p>
				Interest earned on BlockFi is paid out monthly and can be withdrawn at any time. BlockFi recently introduced a fiat onramp with US-leader Silvergate - meaning users can now purchase Bitcoin directly with a USD wire. There are no minimum deposits required to lend Bitcoin on BlockFi			</p>

						<p>
				While most lending DeFi rates vary between 1% and 3%, there are some digital assets that can generate a much higher DeFi yield. At the moment of writing, Curve token had an 11% APY, on the Ethereum network. These rates are subject to change, according to the market.			</p>

				Interest rates from the top cryptocurrency lending protocols and crypto banks - updated every hour!. To stay up with all things DeFi, sign up for our newsletter - delivered every Friday with a recap of top stories from the past week.			</p>

				1st year: 200 DFI Block Reward. 2nd year: 150 DFI Block Reward. 3rd year: 100 DFI Block Reward. 4th year: 70 DFI Block Reward. 5th year: 50 DFI Block Reward. …. 11th year: 0 DFI Block Reward. To estimate current rewards under the assumption of more or fewer users staking, feel free to check out the DeFiChain Staking Rewards Calculator.			</p>

						<p>
				This rate has created a rift in the DeFi ecosystem as many lending projects are reliant on the DSR to drive Dai lending rates. The bright side of this rate is that minting new Dai has never been cheaper, with all collateral types having at or near 0% stability fee - meaning there is no incurred debt on an outstanding loan.			</p>

						<p>
				Interest rate: 8% APY (or 12% APY when the interest is paid in NEXO) Supported stablecoins: USDC, USDT, UST, DAI, USDP, TUSD, USDX, ... CeFi and DeFi platforms with good interest rates can generate a decent amount of yield. If you want to keep a part of your crypto portfolio in stablecoins, ...			</p>

				June 2022. Our full list of cryptocurrency DeFi interest rates shows the best platform to stake your crypto with in order to maximise your yield. We show the highest base level interest rate for each coin. This is the best instant access interest rate that requires no investment in the DeFi platform's own token.			</p>

						<p>
				Generally speaking, interest rates on CeFi seem higher than large and well adopted DeFi platforms. However, on a recent DeFi platform, hence riskier, it's possible to achieve higher yields. What is USDC and why USDC and not USDT? As seen in the table above, I only display rates for the USDC stablecoins, and not the most popular one, USDT. Why?			</p>

						<p>
				Dynamic - The vast majority of borrowing in DeFi leverages variable interest rates which shift relative to the utilization ratio of any given asset. Perpetual - DeFi loans can be opened for any amount of time, so long as the debt is paid back and the position is sufficiently collateralized Top Picks			</p>

						<p>
				When prices crash, DeFi users need cash to keep their positions from getting liquidated. That causes a lot of rebalancing activity throughout the space which can create dislocations. For example, Notional's interest rates moved substantially over the past week due to a few large liquidity redemptions following the price crash.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound isn't alone in offering market-beating interest rates. According to DeFi Rate's regularly updated lending rates, Aave currently offers 9.53% to lenders of DAI and 18.34% to lenders of TrueUSD. Nuo offers 12.05% to lenders of USDC, while BlockFi offers 6% for bitcoin and 8.6% Gemini dollars, to name only a few.			</p>

						<p>
				For example, while the average savings rate offered by US banks is only 0.09% per year, DeFi deposits offer up to 5% on average, accruing interest every 15 seconds.			</p>

						<p>
				Rather than having a fixed-rate bond, the crypto savings protocol offers a product that's based on the average returns from lending platforms. For example, if the average returns on Aave are 10%, 88MPH might offer a short-term fixed interest rate of 7.5%. A longer-term deposit, up to one year, could earn a yield of 2.5%.			</p>

						<p>
				On the most basic end of that complexity, interest rate swaps in DeFi unlock fixed rate products. For the first time, DeFi users can now take assets with variable rates of return and turn them into fixed-rate assets. Until recently, DeFi users seeking yield have been subject to interest rates that can fluctuate wildly.			</p>

						<p>
				Like in traditional finance, lending rates in DeFi are ultimately determined by supply & demand. There are multiple reasons why the demand for borrowing is high in DeFi resulting in high interest rates. First, DeFi is global by definition so it brings borrowers from all over the world to the table.			</p>
