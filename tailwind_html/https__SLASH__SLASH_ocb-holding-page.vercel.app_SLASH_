    <h2 class="mt-4">JOIN IN</h2>

    <p>We are running Sunday evening services. Every other week is
    our contemplative service 'Be Still and Know' where there is
    space for you to spend time with God in a guided and helpful
    way. The alternate week we will be thinking through some big
    themes of our lives and where we might find God in them
    (outline below). Again you would be very welcome to come along
    to one of these evenings. At the moment we don't foresee the
    need for a booking service but if that changes we will give
    details of that here.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="w-2/3 text-center mx-auto">
    <p class="my-4">Being church is about being connected. If you'd
    like to connect more with the life of the church and join in
    our small groups, times of prayer and reflection, discussions
    on Facebook, book clubs, kids groups and all sorts of other
    things, then just email Kath Cunningham at <a href=
    "mailto:kath@onechurchbrighton.org">kath@onechurchbrighton.org</a>
    and she will pop you into our weekly email list so you can see
    what's on and get involved.</p>

    <p class="my-4">If you're interested in being a part of our
    Sunday services, then head to our <a target="_blank" href=
    "https://youtube.com/onechurchbrightonchannel/">Youtube
    channel</a> where you can be a part of our next live stream
    this Sunday at 10.30am. You'll also find past services and
    short devotionals that we're putting together to help each
    other engage with God, ourselves and the world around us.</p>

    <p class="my-4">If you're more into audio than video, then you
    may wish to listen to our podcast. It's available nearly
    everywhere that podcasts can be found, so either search "One

    <p class="my-4">The running of all of our projects, the upkeep

    Church thriving, costs a significant amount of money! If One
    Church is your church and you'd like to give regularly then why
    not join many others in setting up a Standing Order, you can
    find out more details from Claire by emailing <a href=
    "mailto:claire@onechurchbrighton.org">claire@onechurchbrighton.org</a>.</p>
