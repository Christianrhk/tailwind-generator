			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>Good morning friends, family, and a special good morning to IceBreakers Nation!</p>

<p>In last nights playoff game your IceBreakers were able to complete the come from behind victory in our first playoff match as we walked away with the 3-2 victory.</p>

<p>In the first period Parkwood would pick up the first goal at the 14:02 mark, putting your IceBreakers behind 1-0 in the first period.</p>

<p>In the second period center Ryan Pinney would tie the game at 14:49, goal assisted by LW Glenn Hall.  Your IceBreakers would fid themselves in a little bit of penalty problems as they were two men down and Parkwood would capitalize and score at the 11:34 mark making the score 2-1 Parkwood.</p>

<p>At the 7:23 mark in the second period, a time out was taken by the IceBreakers to readjust and refocus, as lines were jumbled and switched around, hoping to generate some offense.</p>

<p>In the third period your IceBreakers would come out strong trying not to let go of the lead, as both teams would play a very strong defensive game trading opportunities but not converting. </p>

<p>Then at the 4:00 mark of the third period  RW Josh Wilkins would be in the perfect spot to blow a shot past the goaltender making the score 2-2 at this point with the goal being assisted once again by Glenn Hall.</p>

<p>Then at the 2:47 mark of the third period your IceBreakers would strike as line one would get a perfect opportunity as Center and assistant captain Eric Wilkins would put the puck in past the goalie pushing the score to 3-2 IceBreakers, with the goal assisted by LW Paris Elliott and LD Joshua Prince.  Parkwood would call their time out trying desperately to find an answer but your IceBreakers would not be denied as the final horn would sound with the IceBreakers going home with the 3-2 victory.</p>

<p>Goaltending was absolutely stellar especially in the third period where what looked like a sure goal was stopped by Peter Mangels as he would make a diving save to keep the puck out of the net.  Everyone was focused and ready to play, complete team effort and a great win!</p>

<p>Next game will be today (Saturday March 23rd, 2019) as we look to get another victory as we take on Tasta Pizza at 12:00pm.</p>

<p>We hope to see many people out for are game as also at 4:00pm will be our 3rd game against KA-BAR2, and the championship game set for 8:00PM.  Thank you to everyone who came out last night as it was truly a great game with spectacular results!  <br />🇺🇸🦈🏒🔥</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>Good evening to all of our friends and families out there and a very special good evening to IceBreaker Nation. In this weeks edition we will be talking about the game last Sunday (February 24th, 2019) against the yellow team known as VAVALOS in where you IceBreakers were handed a 2-1 loss. </p>

<p>Your IceBreakers had been on a winning streak prior to last Sundays lost, including winning the 3V3 Tournament the day before. From the very start of the game against team VAVALOS the “mood” was set to “anger and disgust” as it seamed as if players were “head hunting.” Not trying to be distracted by this unnecessary play your IceBreakers did get on the board first as #15 C – Jordan Stiles (19G,18A) would take a pass from #21 C, assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (14G, 24A) at the 11:48 mark. Momentum seemed to sway your IceBreakers way as by the end if the first period the score would remain your #IceBreakers 1 and VAVALOS 0.</p>

<p>#30 G, Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all pucks that he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, VAVALOS would come out strong and at the 17:18 mark very early they would put one past the goaltender pushing the score to a 1-1 tie. The heat started to turn up, both teams started to take penalties left and right. Then at the 5:00 mark in the second saw your IceBreaker on the Power Plat however it would work against them as a turnover would result on an odd man rush back the other way and VAVALOS would score a short handed goal making the score 2-1 VAVALOS till the end of the third period.</p>

<p>#30 G Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all shots he faced in this second period except two.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period, it was evident that VAVALOS were determined to show just why they are a surprising upcoming team and also that they were content on the score. The final period saw no goals but many other penalties. There were plenty of times both sides should have had players ejected before the end of the game, but it was not to be. As the final horn blew a “line brawl” would break out towards the VAVALOS corner with both benches clearing and everyone finding a partner. Game misconducts were handed out and suspensions would follow. Then in the handshake line as the dust seamed to clear it would all start again as a VAVALOS player would jump one of your IceBreakers players and more game misconducts would be handed out along with more suspensions.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks that was thrown his way in this final period, however it was not enough to get the win leaving his record at 13 wins, 8 losses, and 1 tie so far this season.</p>

<p>As a result of the &quot;line brawl incident&quot; forward Ryan Pinney is SUSPENDED from play on Satuday March 2nd, 2019 and Sunday March 3rd, 2019, also defenceman James Rennells is SUSPENDED from play on Satuday March 2nd, 2019 and Sunday March 3rd, 2019, both players will be eligible to return to game action on Sunday March 10th, 2019. This rule was handed down by the OMHL2, no further actions will be taken in this matter.</p>

<p>My guys came out ready to play hockey, we did not provoke or antagonize anymore then the other team did, in fact we did less than they did. You can only sit back and take so much for so long before it gets to a boiling point. I think it’s a joke we have players in this league that seam they have only one thing on their mind other than hockey. Other than that, we did our best and that is all that matters, should we meet them in the playoffs it will be one that will get “circled” on the calendar, you can bet on that.</p>

<p>Thank you, once again, to all those who came out to the game and supported us! We appreciate you coming out! <br />🇺🇸🦈🏒🔥</p></div>

				</div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>We are proud to announce that we have gone (3-0-1) including last weeks big victory, handing the only “undefeated“ team their first loss in regulation this season, to secure the second overall spot in the OMHL2 and one point shy of clinching a playoff birth this season. </p>

<p>Your IceBreakers have been on a win streak as of late, as already previously stated, going 3-0-1 in their last 4 games and sitting comfortably in second place with 7 games remaining in the 2018-2019 regular season, and staring down a birth in the OMHL2 playoffs and a shot at the OMHL2 Challenge Cup for the first time in team history. That being said, in last week’s game against Mickey’s your IceBreakers would prevail and hand the Mickey’s team their first loss this season by a final score of 4-2. <br />It was all hands-on deck for your IceBreakers as they seemed focused and ready to go, even shorthanded, the determination was there as they would not be denied this one. The first goal would come from Mickey’s at the 12:58 mark of the first period as a little bit of a scramble along with a turnover would leave the goaltender venerable and that would lead to a goal and the score would be 1-0 Mickey’s. The next goal would be a result of line two working hard as at the 9:38 mark #84 LW – Glenn Hall (2G, 0A) would pick up the rebound shot from #4 C – Ryan Pinney (23G, 25A) and #2 RW – Josh Wilkins (2G, 6A) on a delayed penalty making the score 1-1 at this point. Then at the 3:13 mark #91 LD – Brandon Miller (22G, 16A) would take the puck cost to cost and blow a slap shot past the goaltender making the score 2-1 IceBreakers at this point and it would remain this way till the end of the first period.</p>

<p>#30 G, Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but one shot he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, Mickey’s would buckle down defensively as it started to become a bit of a chippy game, however your IceBreakers would have an answer to this as at the 13:09 mark #21 C, assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (13G, 20A) would take advantage of a careless Mickey’s pass in their offensive zone, breaking in on the goaltender and putting past him high shoulder side, making the score 3-1 IceBreakers at this point as this is how the rest of the period would look on the score sheet.</p>

<p>#30 G Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all shots he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period, it was evident that Mickey’s were determined to show just why they were the number one team in the OMHL2, as they would come out strong by scoring the next goal at the 13:57 mark making the score 3-2 at this point. Your IceBreakers would not be intimated and continued to play smart hockey as team Mickey’s would begin to get frustrated as at the 10:42 mark they would take an unnecessary tripping penalty as the defender and forward would go head first into the boards. Your IceBreakers would see a great opportunity as they would put their best forwards and defenseman out on the ice for this important power play. Managing the clock well and passing perfect they would see the opportunity as at the 9:42 mark #4 C – Ryan Pinney (24G, 25A) would blast the puck past the goaltender with the goal being scored on the power play, with the assist going to #5 LW – Paris Elliot (17G, 19A) making the score 4-2 midway trough the third period. Mickey’s would come harder at your #IceBreakers including calling a time out at about the two-minute mark and pulling their goaltender, however your #IceBreakers were to much and they would not capitalize with the extra attacker and the final score would end up in a 4-2 victory, and first loss for Mickey’s.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks but one that was thrown his way in this final period, securing his twelfth win in nineteen games this season moving to a winning record of 12 wins, 6 losses, and 1 tie so far this season.</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>2018 has been a special year for your IceBreakers, full of downs, but many ups as well!  Let’s look at this last Saturday nights (December 29th, 2018) fifteenth and final regular season game for the 2018 year. </p>

<p>Your IceBreakers were able to prevail against the Barkin K9s and secure their 9th win and move to a 9-6 record by defeating the Barkin K9s with a final score of 5-4 and remain towards the top of the OMHL2 standings.<br />It was all hands-on deck for your IceBreakers as they seemed focused and ready to go with a full roster this past week.  Both teams would have great defensive strides going back and forth early in the opening period.  The first goal would come curtsy of the Barkin K9s at the 12:07 mark of the first period as a little bit of a scramble would leave the goaltender venerable and that would lead to a goal and the score would be 1-0 Barkin K9s.  The next goal would be a result of line two working hard as at the 5:15 mark #91 LW – Brandon Miller (15G, 12A) would take a slap shot to beat the goaltender with the goal assisted by #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (16G, 18A) making the score 1-1.  Then about three minutes at the 2:06 mark #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (10G, 13A) would have a great fore-checking moment and steal the puck on a bad pass in the Barkin K9s defensive zone, break in, and put a wrist shot behind the goaltender making the score 3-1 you IceBreakers.  Next with the seconds ticking away line two would once again answer the call as with 0.06 seconds left in the opening 18 minutes #15 C – Jordan Stiles (12G, 11A) would throw a puck at the net and it would go in with that goal being assisted by #91 LW – Brandon Miller (15G, 13A) and by #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (16G, 19A) to end the first period with the score being 3-1 your IceBreakers.  </p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but one shot he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, the Barkin K9s would not be denied, and they would show it, as at the 16:45 mark they would score a goal making the score 3-1 very early in the second period.  Looking for an answer the IceBreakers were able to pick up an answering goal as at the 11:23 mark #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (17G, 19A) would work hard in-front of the net and push it past the goaltender with the goal being assisted by #91 LW – Brandon Miller (15G, 14A) and #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (10G, 14A) making the score 4-2 your IceBreakers at this point until the end of the second period as both teams once again would pick it up defensively not wanting to make a mistake.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all but one shot he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period, the Barkin K9s would once again look as if they would not be denied as at the 11:53 mark they would get another goal that would make the score 4-3 at this point.  Wanting to keep the game close it was decided to not rotate the three lines and go with the two just to match up.  The third period would not have any scoring until the end of the third as the Barkin K9s would take a penalty and send your IceBreakers on the Power Play.  Your IceBreakers would capitalize on the Power play as at the 1:02 mark #2 RD – Josh Wilkins (2G, 5A) would jump up on the play and put a wrist shot past the goaltender with the goal being assisted by #5 LW – Paris Elliot (12G, 14A) making the score 5-3.  The last goal would come from the Barking K9s at about 7 seconds later at the 0:54 mark making the score 5-4 till the end of the third period.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks but two that was thrown his way in this final period, securing his ninth win in fifteen games this season moving to a winning record of 9 wins and 6 losses for the year of 2018.</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>The IceBreakers seamed focused and ready to go but Tasta Pizza came out very hard and quick and did not want to be denied.  Scoring first at 17:40 was Tasta Pizza on what seamed like a lot of confusion on the part of the #IceBreakers top line that was out there, making the score a very early 1-0.  Three minutes later at 12:01 Tasta Pizza would again score pushing the score to 3-0 at this point.  Your #IceBreakers were getting notably frustrated but still had determination all the way through till the end of the first period.    Hoping to remedy that a line change was made very quickly to send line two out to see what they could do.  It was two minutes later at 15:20 Tasta Pizza would break out again and put another goal past the IceBreakers goaltender and make it 2-0.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but three shot he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, your IceBreakers seemed to be determined to come back and prove they are a top team.  It seamed as if defensively they locked in and were able to shut down the Tasta Pizza offensive weapons.  At the 4:05 mark towards the end of the second period #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (16G, 15A) found himself alone infrot of the net and took a quick slapshot that went five hole and found the back of the net with the goal being assisted by #2 LD – Josh Wilkins (1G, 4A) and by #15 C – Jordan Stiles (9G, 10A) making the score 3-1.  Just shortly after the goal your IceBreakers found themselves in a little bit of penalty trouble, and right after the penalty ended at the 1:12 mark #91 LW – Brandon Miller (11G, 11A) took a quick wrister that beat the goaltender by a pretty pass from #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (16G, 16A) and by #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (7G, 13A) making the score 3-2 Tasta Pizza till the end of the second period.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all shots he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period, your IceBreakers again showed great determination as all lines where just itching to get the tying goal.  With determination comes irresponsibility and your IceBreakers found themselves in a little bit of penalty trouble, but not to be denied at the 8:28 mark of the third period being down three skaters to five #91 LW – Brandon Miller (12G, 11A) broke in on the Tasta Pizza goaltender and beat him short side, shorthanded to tie the game at 3-3 with the goal being assisted by #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (16G, 17A) and #5 RD – Paris Elliott (12G, 11A).  As the penalties expired to your #IceBreakers, Tasta Pizza then found themselves in the penalty box putting the #IceBreakers on the Power Play.  Wanting to stick with the second line as it seemed, they had all the chemistry and hot hands, #91 LW – Brandon Miller (13G, 11A) was able to score on the Power Play at the 7:47 mark with the goals being assisted by #15 C – Jordan Stiles (9G, 11A) and #2 LD – Josh Wilkins (1G, 5A) making the score 4-3 your IceBreakers.  Towards the end of the third period things started to get physical with both sides determined to get the better end of each other and your IceBreakers found themselves in the penalty box as Tasta Pizza pulled the goaltender and the game was six skaters versus three.  Taking the timeout quickly a plan was talked about to make sure we did not try to score we already had the win, just chip it out and slow the game down.  Tasta Pizza had chances and between the great penalty kill and superb goaltending your IceBreakers were able to kill the penalty and end the game with the 4-3 victory to snap the loosing streak.<br /> <br />Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks that was thrown his way in this final period, securing his seventh win in twelve games this season.</p></div>

				</div>
			</div>
			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>In Sunday nights (December 2nd, 2018) eleventh regular season game your IceBreakers were on the receiving end of their third consecutive loss in the last four games as the second meeting with KA-BAR2 did not go their way as they were handed a 4-3 loss.</p>

<p>The IceBreakers were able to contain KA-BAR2 very well for the first portion of the opening period. It seamed like it was going to be a low scoring game as both sides were playing great defensive hockey. KA-BAR2 would open the scoring as at the 12:52 mark they would let a quick wrister go that was initially stopped but a mad scramble in front with no one to clear it out would result in a goal putting KA-BAR2 up 1-0. As the period wore on your #IceBreakers would push back and at the 6:58 mark #5 LW – Paris Elliott (12G, 9A) would shoot the puck high stick side to beat the goalie with the goal being assisted by #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (7G, 11A) tieing the game up at 1-1 till the end of the first period.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but one shot he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, KA-BAR2 would find themselves on the receiving end of a high sticking penalty, putting your IceBreakers on an early Power Play, however, the IceBreakers could not get anything to work on the Power Play and a bad pass would lead to a two on two break out which would see KA-BAR2 score a short handed goal at the 15:32 mark putting them up 2-1 at this point. Not but a minute later at the 14:22 mark KA-BAR2 would put another goal in making it 3-1 at this point. New comer #74 LD – Noah Schutte (1G, 0A) would make his presence known to your #IceBreakers and the OMHL2 as at the 9:46 mark he would take the puck from behind his own goaltender take it up the ice and blast a puck that dinged loudly off the crossbar and in making the score 3-2 with the goal being assisted by #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (15G, 15A). Shortly before the end of the second period KA-BAR2 would get another quick goal at the 2:50 mark scoring on a Power Play making the score 4-2 KA-BAR2 till the end of the second.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all shots but three he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period, your IceBreakers did start to show a little push back as things started to get rough with both teams wanting to get more goals and prove their worth, #74 LD – Noah Schutte (2G, 0A) was able to one again answer the call as he would put his second goal in with the goal being assisted by #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (7G, 12A) and #5 LW – Paris Elliott (12G, 10A). Throughout the third period there were chances for both sides but defensively they stood strong. Towards the end of the third KA-BAR2 would find themselves two men short as they would take two penalties. Your #IceBreakers pulled the goalie in favor of a six skater to four skater advantage with chances coming including two going off the posts but no one could capitalize and the buzzer would sound on the final score being 4-3 KA-BAR2.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks that was thrown his way in this final period, however he would take his fifth loss in eleven games this season pushing his record to 6 wins and 5 losses (still a great record).</p>

<p>There was determination on everyone’s face, we seamed revitalized with the addition of Noah, however it just was not enough to get the win. I believe the guys worked hard against a very good KA-BAR2 team. We are on a three-game slide and we need to evaluate from within our group. We need to get back to the small things that made us successful in the beginning of the season. All too many times we are trying to make the pretty passes or take the perfect shots and we cannot continue to think those opportunities are out there or that we are that good.</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>The IceBreakers were able to get a very quick goal (40 seconds) at the 17:40 mark as #12 LD - James Rennells (1G, 1A) has strong forechecking, stole the puck, and shot it short side to beat the goaltender, the goal was unassisted.  The next goal would come towards the end of the first period as #15 C – Jordan Stiles (9G, 9A) would take a pass from #12 LD - James Rennells (1G, 2A) and score putting the IceBreakers up 2-0 at the 5:45 mark.  Two minutes later at the 3:25 mark Parkwood would answer with a quick wrister that would fool the IceBreakers goaltender making it 2-1 to end the first period.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but one shot he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, Parkwood would come out strong and not let up as they dominated the first half of the second period.  At the 14:22 mark Parkwood would get on the board with a backhand shot that found its way in the back of the net making the score 2-2 at this point.  Parkwood would continue their dominance by getting another goal just about one minute later at the 13:26 mark, pushing the score to 3-2 Parkwood.  Frustration was evident for your IceBreakers as they seamed to not be able to generate anything.  Determined, however, line one was able to get on the board at the 6:43 mark as #5 LW – Paris Elliott (11G, 8A) would break in and score on his own rebound after the goaltender stopped the first shot but not the second with the assist going to #87 RW – Joseph Smelko (2G, 3A) making it 3-3 at this point.  Parkwood would have another answer for that goal as at the 3:23 mark they would get another goal that would make the score 4-3 Parkwood at this point.  Trying desperately to get back on the board, #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (6G, 10A) was able to redirect a shot taken from #18 RD – Brokton Ludden (0G, 6A) at the 1:22 mark to tie the game up at 4-4.  Parkwood would not give up and about 40 seconds later they would get a quick goal to make the score 5-4 Parkwood, as that would be how the second period would end with your IceBreakers down.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all shots but four he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period it was much of the same story as your IceBreakers seamed to continue to be dominated.  Parkwood would get on the board first as at the 12:49 mark they would score a slapshot goal making it 6-4 Parkwood at this point.  A few minutes later #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (7G, 10A) would buary a goal past the Parkwood goaltender assisted by #5 LW – Paris Elliott (11G, 9A) to make it a one goal game at this point with the score being 6-5 Parkwood.  Although your #IceBreakers had some good opportunities they just could not capitalize, and Parkwood kept coming at your IceBreakers as at the 5:20 mark they would score again making it 7-5 at this point.  Almost two minutes later at the 3:03 mark they would once again get one past the goaltender making the score 8-5 Parkwood.  With almost one-minute remaining in the third period at the 1:05 mark as #4 RW – Ryan Pinney (15G, 13A) would pick up his own rebound to find the back of the net making the score 8-6 Parkwood, and that is how the score would stay making it a loss for your IceBreakers.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all but three pucks that was thrown his way in this final period, however he would take his first loss in four games this season.</p>

<p>There was determination on everyone’s face, however it just was not enough to get the win.  Parkwood out worked the IceBreakers from the start and did not let up.  They were able to shut our top scores down for the most part and we learned we rely on them way to much.  There were also some coaching mistakes made in this game, who to sit, who to play.  Parkwood deserved to win.</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>The IceBreakers knew coming into this game this would be a hard-fought battle as right from the beginning of the game it was chippy.  Three minutes into the game the number one line was able to get on the board first for your IceBreakers as at the 17:55 mark saw  #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (4G, 8A) take a lead pass from #5 LW – Paris Elliott (7G, 7A), and by , #87 RW – Joseph Smelko (2G, 1A), to put your IceBreakers up by a score of 1-0.  Guns &amp; Hoses started to take unnecessary penalties as they tried to get into your IceBreakers heads, as they found themselves two men down and your IceBreakers on a two man advantage.  The IceBreakers were able to capitalize as at the 12:08, 20 seconds into the first power play #15 C – Jordan Stiles (6G, 1A) took a quick wrist shot to fool the goaltender scoring on the power play with the goal assisted by #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (8G, 8A) and #13 captain – Joshua Prince (0G, 8A).  The #IceBreakers were not able to score on the second power play, however about a minute after it ended at the 9:01 mark we saw #91 LW – Brandon Miller (6G, 7A) streaking down the ice and put it past the Guns &amp; Hoses goaltender with the goal assisted by #15 C – Jordan Stiles (6G, 2A) and by #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (8G, 9A).  Guns &amp; Hoses were not to be denied this period as with 30 seconds to go in the first there were able to pop in a goal as by the end of the first period the score would be 3-1 IceBreakers.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but one shot he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period, it was all Guns &amp; Hoses early as they seemed to have life as at the 14:15 mark there were able to get a goal as there was a mad scramble in front of the IceBreakers goaltender to push the score to 3-2. Then only about a minute later at the 13:23 mark Guns &amp; Hoses worked the puck well as their skaters pushed up the puck that sent one of them on a break away, and he beat the goaltender to make it an even 3-3 score almost half way through the second period.  Your IceBreakers were visibly upset but continued to work hard.  Then at the 3:46 mark of the second period #91 LW – Brandon Miller (7G, 7A) took a hard shot that made it past the goaltender with the goal being assisted by #15 C – Jordan Stiles (6G, 3A) and by #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (8G, 10A) to make the score 4-3 IceBreakers, and that is how it would stay till the end of the period.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all shots but 2 he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period your IceBreakers did not give up and kept the foot on the gas as at the 14:20 mark #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (9G, 10A) took a back hand shot to put it past the Guns &amp; Hoses goaltender with the goal assisted by #15 C – Jordan Stiles (6G, 4A) and by #91 LW – Brandon Miller (7G, 8A) making the score 5-3.  Guns &amp; Hoses would answer with a goal of their own at the 10:46 mark of the 3rd period making it 5-4.  Your IceBreakers would answer very quickly (30 seconds later to be exact) at the 10:16 mark #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (10G, 10A) took a lead pass from #15 C – Jordan Stiles (6G, 5A) to make it 6-4 IceBreakers.  To cap off the scoring your IceBreakers found themselves working the puck around waiting for a clear shot in the Guns &amp; Hoses end when #13 captain – Joshua Prince (1G, 8A) wound up and fire a slap shot past the Guns &amp; Hoses goaltender from the blue line with the goal assisted by #15 C – Jordan Stiles (6G, 6A) and #91 LW – Brandon Miller (7G, 9A).  That is where the score would stay as the final buzzer would sound with a 7-4 victory for your IceBreakers.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all but 1 puck that was thrown his way in this final period securing his fifth win of this young season</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>Good evening to all of our friends and families out there and a special good evening to IceBreakernation! </p>

<p>In Sunday nights (October 21st, 2018) fifth regular season game your IceBreakers were able to defeat the number one team currently in the OMHL2, team VAVALOS, by a final score of 5-2.</p>

<p>The IceBreakers shook of those slow starts that plagued them in the past few games and came out very strong and fast and it seemed to wear down VAVALOS.  The IceBreakers were able to get a few early goals in the first period.  The first goal was scored by #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (6G, 6A) on a pretty pass play and a first assist by #13 captain – Joshua Prince (0G, 4A), and a second assist by #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (2G, 3A).  Then, about five minutes your #IceBreakers struck again as #2 LD – Josh Wilkins (1G, 0A) joined the rush and took a quick wrist shot that beat the goaltender with the goal assisted by #18 RD – Brokton Ludden (0G, 2A) to end the period with a 2-0 lead.     </p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all shots he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period as team VAVALOS turned up the heat on your IceBreakers, as they were able to sneak, what looked like a harmless shot past assistant captain Pete Mangels to bring the score to 2-1.  Midway through the second period it started to get a little rough as team VAVALOS took a penalty for running a player into the boards which sent the IceBreakers on the Power Play.  The IceBreakers were able to capitalize on the man advantage as #5 LW Paris Elliott (4G, 3A) shot it past the goaltender with that goal assisted by #13 captain – Joshua Prince (0G, 5A), as a second assist by #21 assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (2G, 4A).  Team VAVALOS was able to get one more past the IceBreakers goaltender towards the end of the period to bring the score to a 3-2 score.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all but 2 shots he faced in this second period.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third and final period your IceBreakers did not give up at all.  They came out strong again in the third as it continued to be a chipy game.  At about 3 minutes into the third #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (7G, 6A) broke out with #91 LW – Brandon Miller (4G, 5A) and put it past the goaltender to push the score to 4-2.  Both sides continued to play a physical game with both taking unnecessary penalties, however, neither team was able to score with the man advantage.  With about 5 minutes left in the game #91 LW – Brandon Miller (5G, 5A) snapped a quick shot that was once again able to find the back of the net with the goal assisted by #13 captain – Joshua Prince (0G, 6A).  Time would eventually run down as the final  buzzer sounded with the final score being a 5-2 victory.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks that were thrown his way in this final period securing his third win of this young season.</p>

<p>The effort was much improved, as opposed to the previous weeks, in terms of starts.  We wanted to have a quick start and we did that.  We knew coming into this game we were facing the number one team in the league and in order to compete we had to jump out quickly and not let up and we did that.  It was a great overall game and we are going to enjoy this one.</p>

<p>Thank you, once again, to all those who came out to the game! We appreciate the support and we hope to see you out again this Sunday (October 28th) as we continue our season series and look for another win as we take on the Barkin K9s with a puck drop of 8:00 PM.</p></div>

Many apologies again for the late delay in game action results; but as was said once already, better late than not at all!</p>

<p>In Sunday nights (October 14th, 2018) fourth regular season game your IceBreakers  suffered defeat at the hands of Four Mile Brewing at an attempted comeback win that fell short by a final score of 3-2.</p>

<p>The IceBreakers admittedly came out a little bit on the slow side again in the first period with players not being able to pull it together, almost as if we were missing an important cog in our machine.  Four Mile Brewing had great pressure on your IceBreakers and were able to put in two goals past the net-minder.<br /> <br />Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all shots but 2 he faced in this opening period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period it was almost the same for your IceBreakers in terms of just not looking as good as should be.  A Four Mile Brewing skater took a quick shot that went high on the goaltender and pushed it to 3-0 very early in the second period.   Your IceBreakers made a few quick line changes in hopes of generating some chemistry, to no avail. </p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels once again was able to stop all pucks that were thrown his way except one.</p>

<p>Turning now to the third period, Coach Currier completely juggled the lines looking for some kind of spark to breathe life into the lines.  Your IceBreakers came out stronger after line juggling as a comeback attempt started to look possible as midway through the third period #15 C – Jordan Stiles (4G, 1A) took a quick pass from #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (5G, 5A) also assisted by #91 LW – Brandon Miller (3G, 4A) to beat the netminder.  Then about 3 minutes later #91 LW – Brandon Miller (4G, 4A) snapped a wrister that fooled the goaltender with the goal assisted by #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (5G, 6A) and by #5 LW Paris Elliott (3G, 3A).  Lady momentum seamed to be changing addresses as Four Mile Brewing took a penalty late in the third.  Coach Currier called a timeout to go over lines and the next play.  Your IceBreakers  had a lot of pressure on Four Mile Brewing, the IceBreakers pulled the goaltender to go skating 6v4 with lots of energy and chances however nothing to show for it as that would be all the scoring for the night with the game ending in a 3-2 loss for your IceBreakers.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels was able to stop all pucks that were thrown his way in this final period.</p>

<p>What we can take from this is not the fact that we suffered a loss, but it was the effort that was given just to have the opportunity at a comeback.  The team stared down adversity and almost pulled off a win, that is what we would rather see.  The loss is welcome if there was effort!</p>

<p>Thank you, once again, to all those who came out to the game!  We appreciate the support and we hope to see you out again this Sunday (October 21st) as we look to rebound from the loss and add another “W” in our next match-up against VAVALOS with a puck drop of 8:00 PM.</p></div>

<p>In Sunday nights (October 7th, 2018) third regular season game your IceBreakers defeated Tasta Pizza in a hard fought game by a final score of 4-1.<br />The IceBreakers admittedly came out a little bit on the slow side but picked it up mid-way through the first period as there was a scramble in front of the Tasta Pizza’s net minder and #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (4G, 4A) was able to beat the goaltender assisted by #11 RD Justin Gutowski (0G, 1A) and by #91 LW – Brandon Miller (1G, 3A). Then at about the 16-minute mark of the 1st period #91 LW – Brandon Miller (2G, 3A) took a quick shot that fooled the net-minder bringing the score at the end of the first of 2-0 with that goal being unassisted.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels stopped all 11 shots he faced this period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period it was once again a very strong defensive chess match of a game with both sides being cautious. Then at the 10:00 minute mark #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (5G, 4A) took a quick shot that was able to beat the goaltender assisted by #91 LW – Brandon Miller (1G, 4A) to bring the score at the end of the period to 3-0.</p>

<p>Assistant Captain Pete Mangels once again was able to stop all pucks that were thrown his way having stopped 10 more shots.</p>

<p>Midway through the third period Tasta Pizza started to show signs of life as they fore-checked the puck very well and it started to get a little dicey, it led to great opportunities, one they would capitalize on as they would get an opportunity to fool the #IceBreakers net-minder leaving the score at 3-1. Then only a few minutes #5 LW Paris Elliott (3G, 2A) took a clean pass and put it past the goaltender, assisted #21 center and assistant captain – Eric Wilkins (1G, 3A). That would be all the scoring for the night with the game ending in a 4-1 win for your IceBreakers.</p>

<p>Thank you, once again, to all those who came out to the game and we hope to see you out again this Sunday (October 14th) as we look to add another “W” in our next match-up against Four Mile Brewing with a puck drop of 8:00 PM.</p>

<p>In last nights second regular season game your IceBreakers lost a heart-breaker to KA-BAR2 by a final score of of 3-1</p>

<p>The IceBreakers came out very strong from the start as it was a great defensive game all night.</p>

<p>In the first period scoring early for your IceBreakers last night were #4 RW - Ryan Pinney (3G, 4A) assisted by #2 LD Josh Wilkins (0G, 1A) and #5 LW - Paris Elliott (2G, 2A).  At about the 7 minute mark  #21 C - Eric Wilkins found himself in the penalty box for an interference call, however the, IceBreakers were able to kill off the penalty successfully.</p>

<p>Pete Mangels stopped all the pucks coming at him in this period.</p>

<p>Looking towards the second period it got to be a very strong defensive chess match of a game with both sides being cautious.  Then at the 15:00 minute mark #5 LW Paris Elliott found himself in the penalty box after a stoppage in play where there was some pushing and shoving going on as it started to get a little chippy out there  and once again the IceBreakers were able to kill off another penalty successfully    </p>

<p>Pete Mangels once again was able to stop all pucks that were thrown his way. </p>

<p>Midway through the third period KA-BAR2 showed signs of live as they forechecked the puck very well, leading to great opportunities, one in particular they would capitalize on as they would get a breakaway that fooled the IceBreakers net-minder leaving the score tied 1-1.  Then only a few minutes KA-BAR2 was able to sneak in two more quick goals past the goaltender with the score being 3-1 KA-BAR2.  However, towards the end of the third period KA-BAR2 took an unwise tripping penalty and sent you IceBreakers on the Power Play.  Coach Currier called a timeout as they went over the next play and it was decided to pull the goaltender and skate 6v4 but the IceBreakers just could not get it set up as time ran down and the game ended in a 3-1 loss.</p>

<p>Thank you to all those who came out last night to the game and we hope to see you out again next week (October 8th) as we look to get back on the winning side in our next match-up against Tasta Pizza with a puck drop of 8:00 PM.</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>Hello friends, family, fans, and IceBreaker Nation.</p>

<p>It is with sincere apologies that I say I am sorry for not keeping everyone updated on the status over the past for games.  That being said, here is what you have missed.</p>

<p>Over the last stretch of four games your IceBreakers have gone 1-3 bringing the record to an even 4-4 or 500 record.  The effort has been there, we just need to capitalize better on chances.  Over the past stretch we have juggled lines and we believe that we will have better opportunities and increased goal production.  </p>

<p>Thanks for sticking with us, checking out our quick update.  We&#39;ll see you on the ice!</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>On Sunday night your IceBreakers took a hard loss to Guns &amp; Hoses.  This was not without effort, it was simply a matter of we could not contain by the end of the second period.</p>

<p>Guns &amp; Hoses were a very stacked team (no excuse) however, sometimes you run into teams that are on a different level of playing as you.  Before the end of the second period the game was tied 2-2, but Guns &amp; Hoses just was to much to handle, as the final score was 10-2 loss for your IceBreakers.</p>

<p>We will look to get back on a winning track this Sunday as puck drop is set for 8:00 pm against Brick House, at the Olean Rec Center.</p></div>

			<div class="mt-3 mb-1 leading-normal text-lg whitespace-pre-wrap"><p>The IceBreakers are very proud and excited to launch our new website!  There has been much hard work and dedication that has went into this to get it started.  </p>

<p>This team was started as a dream among life time friends and has now become a reality!  It was our love for the game and the desire to want others to play that had a passion much like us!  It has been a fun ride so far, and we are excited to see what the future holds for IceBreaker hockey.</p>

<p>We will be updating this site along the way.  What we want from you is to tell us what you like or don&#39;t like?!  What would you like to see on our page?  What would you like our team to do for the community?  We are open to any and all suggestions and we would like to hear from you!  If you go to the contact page it will send a direct message to the owner, and he will get back to you.</p>

<p>We would also encourage you to check out our sponsors links as well.  We will be having our own merchandise soon and there already is also a link to donate, if you feel obliged to do so.  When we get the merchandise that will be how you pay for it!</p>

<p>Thanks again to Wayne Boka, Website Developer for helping with this!  The page looks amazing!</p></div>
