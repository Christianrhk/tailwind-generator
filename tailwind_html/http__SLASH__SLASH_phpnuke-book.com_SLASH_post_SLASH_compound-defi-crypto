				Compound is a decentralized, blockchain-based protocol that allows you to lend and borrow crypto — and have a say in its governance with its native COMP token. By Cryptopedia Staff Updated September 29, 2021 • 5 min read Summary			</p>

						<p>
				Compound crypto is a decentralized protocol, or dApp, built on a blockchain. Users can also vote on the governance structure of the Compound protocol using the COMP token. Compound is part of a new system of decentralized finance enabled with the invention of blockchain technology.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound is a decentralized on-chain money market and lending platform, establishing pools of assets with interest rates algorithmically derived from the assets' supply and demand. The main value proposition for Compound is it allows users to earn a yield on their crypto assets without having to custody them with a third party.			</p>

						<p>
				For individuals, Compound is primarily used as a cryptocurrency borrowing and lending protocol. Users can deposit one of the supported tokens into a shared pool at any time and receive interest. Or, after depositing their tokens, they can borrow a smaller amount of tokens and pay interest.			</p>

						<p>
				One of those Lego blocks is the Compound crypto protocol, which allows users to freely and safely earn interest on digital assets. Users who supply an asset to the Compound protocol receive a "cToken" in return, representing their balance in the protocol plus the interest they've earned.			</p>

						<p>
				In terms of locked funds, Compound is the second DeFi platform in the world after MakerDAO. This is a protocol that allows the issuance of decentralized anonymous loans and operates thanks to special smart contracts and the so-called cTokens on the Ethereum blockchain.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound is a company that allows people to earn money on the crypto they save. The project is part of Ethereum and more broadly, DeFi Users can also borrow crypto from Compound by putting up collateral above a threshold defined by the project. In a traditional savings account, you put money into the bank and earn interest on that money.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound is a DeFi borrowing and lending protocol built on Ethereum that functions as the blockchain version of a money market. An analogy with legacy financial institutions might help you understand things better. You must have a savings account in your bank where you deposit money to earn interest.			</p>

						<p>
				What Is Compound (COMP)? Compound is a DeFi lending protocol that allows users to earn interest on their cryptocurrencies by depositing them into one of several pools supported by the platform. To learn more about this project, check out our deep dive of Compound. When a user deposits tokens to a Compound pool, they receive cTokens in return.			</p>

						<p>
				Initially, Compound was a centralized lending platform but largely shifted to being a decentralized platform throughout 2019 and 2020. By July 17th, 2020, it became the largest community-driven decentralized lending platform and a decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) in DeFi following the introduction of its governance token COMP.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound's main goal is to make it so crypto holders get a return on their investment instead of parking them in an account. One of the things that makes Compound unique from the other DeFi protocols is that they have the highest APY. Currently Compounds supports up to 4 wallets and 15 currencies to barrow or supply.			</p>

						<p>
				The Compound protocol is a network of smart contracts based on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to deposit their cryptocurrency and enables borrowing from the pools of supplied assets, instead of getting connected to the peer-to-peer platform.			</p>

				A security and compliance layer was provided by crypto custody firm Fireblocks, which also facilitates the whitelisted Aave Arc DeFi service for institutions, and has been working with Compound ...			</p>

						<p>
				The decentralized project (DeFi) project Compound is Ethereum-based cryptocurrency lending and borrowing platform that allows users to lend and borrow funds from the protocol, earning and paying the interests. Its ERC-20 token COMP is the native governance token that allows holders to propose and vote on all changes to the Compound protocol.			</p>

						<p>
				Put simply, Compound allows users to deposit cryptocurrency into lending pools for access by borrowers. Lenders then earn interest on the assets they deposit. Once a deposit is made, Compound awards a new cryptocurrency called a cToken (which represents the deposit) to the lender. Examples of cTokens include cETH, cBAT and cDAI.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound crypto is basically a decentralized protocol developed over a blockchain. Users have the privilege of dictating governance precedents for the Compound protocol with the help of the COMP token. From a technical perspective, you can think of Compound as a system of smart contracts developed on Ethereum with open accessibility.			</p>

						<p>
				About $90.1 million has mistakenly gone out to users of popular decentralized finance, or DeFi, staking protocol Compound, after an upgrade gone epically wrong. Now, the founder is making a plea ...			</p>

If you're looking for a secure and trusted project for lending and borrowing crypto, MakerDAO is surely the best DeFi project to invest in. PolkaDot (DOT)			</p>

				The compound protocol allows its community to capitalize on investment through its token COMP. COMP is the most contributing lending protocol in the DeFi ecosystem. It became the first DeFi protocol to introduce yield farming to the crypto community. Since then, it has gained global recognition in the industry.			</p>

						<p>
				As of today, the cryptos that are accepted on the Compound platform are: 0x, Augur, Basic Attention Token, DAI, Ether, USD Coin, USDT, Wrapped BTC. For every cryptocurrency you deposit on Compound platform you receive a receipt of deposit in the form of cTokens. That means, for example, if I deposit Ether on the platform, I will receive cEther.			</p>
