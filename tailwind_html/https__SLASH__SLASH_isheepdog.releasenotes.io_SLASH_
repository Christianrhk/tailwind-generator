We have made it easier for the site location to be adjusted by&nbsp;dragging the pin to the precise location on the map. If a job site is not set up in the best location during a job,&nbsp;Dispatchers and Clients can edit the site on the fly and the load counts will automatically adjust.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"\/img\/loading.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/release-assets\/production\/team-2851\/5f2ff54914847_Screen Shot 2020-08-09 at 9.06.42 AM.png\" data-image=\"5f2ff5494b7d1\" width=\"435.91206030150755\" height=\"333\" style=\"width: 435.912px; height: 333px;\"><\/figure>\n<h4>Automatically Watch Job<\/h4>\n<p>Last month, we announced the new Watch Job feature (see the <a href=\"https:\/\/isheepdog.releasenotes.io\/release\/OFWfA-watch-job\" target=\"_blank\">announcement<\/a>).

Background Location is required and an Operator's location is only saved when they are working on a job.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>If you are an Operator that has accepted&nbsp;a job, you will not be able to&nbsp;Check In and start the job unless your location permissions are set up properly.

We now use a machine reading service that will identify and ignore&nbsp;tickets that are&nbsp;uploaded twice or that are bent, partial, or blurry. The app notifies the Operator within a few minutes if the photo uploaded was not clear enough and to retake it.&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p>Here are the warnings the Operator will see when checking out on the Task Report screen under the REVIEW TICKETS section.<\/p>\n<figure><img src=\"\/img\/loading.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/release-assets\/production\/team-2851\/5f3007bee952d_Bad photo.png\" data-image=\"5f3007bf1ed13\" width=\"323.241935483871\" height=\"98\" style=\"width: 323.242px; height: 98px;\"><\/figure>\n<figure><img src=\"\/img\/loading.png\" data-src=\"https:\/\/s3.amazonaws.com\/release-assets\/production\/team-2851\/5f30091b1c0a4_Bad and unclear photo.png\" data-image=\"5f30091b33007\" width=\"320.3240740740741\" height=\"85\" style=\"width: 320.324px; height: 85px;\"><\/figure>\n<p>We will be adding in-app instructions soon to let Operators know how to best take ticket photos.&nbsp;The tip now is to lay&nbsp;a&nbsp;ticket flat and snap a photo of the entire ticket one at a time.<\/p>\n<hr>\n<h2>Other&nbsp;Updates<\/h2>", released_at: "August 10th, 2020", released_at_human: "1 year ago", tags: [ { name: "clients" }, { name: "dispatchers" }, { name: "operators" }, ], owner: { name: "Iron Sheepdog", link: "//isheepdog.releasenotes.io/staff/iron-sheepdog-S0GOs", avatar: "https://www.gravatar.com/avatar/d11a2a564cbbcfe957845209ea6ebef6.jpg?s=200&amp;d=mm"}, involved: [ ], notes: [ { label: "feature", notes: [ { title: "<p>New Task Issue created for Dispatcher and Client verifiers when Operator modifies the load count for the new job type &quot;By Loads&quot;<\/p>", type: "feature", }, { title: "<p>New Task Issue created for Dispatcher and Client verifiers when ticket photo issues have been automatically identified and potentially fixed with a recommendation to manually review<\/p>", type: "feature", }, ], }, { label: "update", notes: [ { title: "<p>Updated directions icon in the site markers on the map<\/p>", type: "update", }, { title: "<p>Reduced size of photo images of tickets to below 4MB<\/p>", type: "update", }, ], }, { label: "bugfix", notes: [ { title: "<p>Invite emails now have no extra whitespace<\/p>", type: "bugfix", }, { title: "<p>Task issues that are autoclosed no longer will have undefined values and negative times<\/p>", type: "bugfix", }, { title: "<p>Job search now works even after filtering first by date<\/p>", type: "bugfix", }, { title: "<p>Task photo with a value but no photo is no longer clickable in the Task Report<\/p>", type: "bugfix", }, ], }, ]},{ uid: "OFWfA", title: "Watch Job", type: "feature", link: "https://isheepdog.releasenotes.io/release/OFWfA-watch-job", private: false, viewable: true, featured_image: "", social_image: "", description: "<p>We have implemented a new Watch Job feature to help you stay focused on just the jobs and trucks you care about.&nbsp;<\/p><p>As a client, you&nbsp;can now select <strong>your<\/strong> job or jobs&nbsp;to watch so that your Dashboard only shows your jobs by default.
