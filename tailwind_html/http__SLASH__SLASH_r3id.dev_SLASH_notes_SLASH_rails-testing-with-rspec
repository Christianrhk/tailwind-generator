<h2 id="what-is-being-used-to-test-in-ruby">What is being used to test in Ruby?</h2>
<p><a href="https://rspec.info" target="_blank">Rspec</a> is possibly the most widely used testing tool in Ruby. If you are going to be learning how to test in Ruby, this is the main tool that you should focus on. Rspec is a <a href="https://opensource.com/article/20/2/domain-specific-languages" target="_blank">domain specific language (DSL)</a>  and is a perfect tool to use for testing in test-driven development.</p>

<h2 id="how-do-you-install-it">How do you install it?</h2>
<p>To install Rspec into a new project, just follow the steps below.</p>

<p>Firstly create a folder. This is where all your files will live. From your terminal, you can create a new folder for this project and name it <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec_tutorial</code>:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>mkdir rspec_tutorial
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Then you should cd into that folder.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>cd rspec_tutorial
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now create a gemfile in your project folder. Note how it is capitalised and that there is no suffix.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>touch Gemfile
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Next, add the following code into your gemfile by copy and pasting the code below.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source 'https://rubygems.org'
gem 'rspec'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now we run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle install</code> from your terminal while still in the project directory. All done! Your project is now set up to use Rspec!</p>

<h2 id="what-are-the-basics-of-rspec">What are the basics of Rspec?</h2>

<p>The basics of an Rspec file contain 3 main sections:</p>
<ul>
  <li>describe,</li>
  <li>it,</li>
  <li>and expect .</li>
</ul>

<p>Of course, there is much more to Rspec, but you can start writing tests with just these 3. I’ll detail the whole test below and then we can break it down afterwards.</p>

<p>The example below will be testing a file that has a class Dog and it has a function #bark that prints out the string Woof! Very important to note that none of that code has been written yet. In test-driven development, we write out the tests first before writing any tests.</p>

<p>First, let’s create a file to house all our tests. We usually split up our tests for every file we create. Since we are expecting to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dog.rb</code> file for our Dog class, we are going to create a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dog.spec.rb</code> file. This is the convention we will follow.</p>

<p>Lets build our test</p>

<p>To create the file, input the following terminal command: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch dog.spec.rb</code></p>

<p>Now you just copy and paste this into your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dog.spec.rb</code> file.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'rspec'
require_relative 'dog'

describe Dog do
  describe '#bark' do
    it 'returns the string "Woof!"' do
      expect(subject.bark).to eql('Woof!')
    end
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>We can start at the top and talk about the first two lines:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>require 'rspec'
require_relative 'dog'
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Here, we are just allowing the file to have rspec functionality with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require 'rspec'</code>. The second line is importing in the file that we are testing: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">require_relative 'dog'</code>. Note how you don’t need to add the extension <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rb</code> when using require_relative.</p>

<p>The next line starts out the scope of our test, and that will be the Dog class.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>describe Dog do
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Within the Dog class, we are going to describe the method we are testing for like this</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>describe Dog do
  describe '#bark' do
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, we are going to describe what the method is meant to do</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>describe Dog do
  describe '#bark' do
    it 'returns the string "Woof!"' do
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Finally, we write out the expectation of what the result is. We wrap the method call in an expect wrapper and declare what it is to equal.</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>describe Dog do
  describe '#bark' do
    it 'returns the string "Woof!"' do
      expect(subject.bark).to eql('Woof!')
    end
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Now, when you run the following code, you will see the test pass or fail: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec dog.spec.rb</code></p>

<p>This will fail because there is no Dog class with a #bark method. Simply add the following code into a new file called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dog.rb</code>.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>An error occurred while loading ./dog.spec.rb.
Failure/Error: require_relative 'dog'

LoadError:
  cannot load such file -- /Users/r3id/Documents/code/learning/rspec_tutorial/dog
# ./dog.spec.rb:2:in `require_relative'
# ./dog.spec.rb:2:in `&lt;top (required)&gt;'
No examples found.

</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="lets-build-our-code">Lets build our code!</h2>

<p>Firstly you will need to create the file from your terminal: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">touch dog.rb</code></p>

<p>Then paste the following code into there:</p>
<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>class Dog
  def bark
    "Meow!"
  end
end
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec dog.spec.rb</code> again to see if your tests pass or fail.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>F

Failures:

  1) Dog#bark returns the string "Woof!"
     Failure/Error: expect(subject.bark).to eql('Woof!')

       expected: "Woof!"
            got: "Meow!"

       (compared using eql?)
     # ./dog.spec.rb:7:in `block (3 levels) in &lt;top (required)&gt;'

Finished in 0.02639 seconds (files took 0.10972 seconds to load)
1 example, 1 failure

Failed examples:

rspec ./dog.spec.rb:6 # Dog#bark returns the string "Woof!"
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>As you can see your test failed. We were expecting the string <strong>“Woof!”</strong> to be returned, but instead we got <strong>“Meow!”</strong>.</p>

<p>So make a quick edit to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bark</code> method, and change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Meow!"</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">"Woof!"</code> the re-run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rspec dog.spec.rb</code>.</p>

<p>Your tests should now all pass!</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>Finished in 0.00827 seconds (files took 0.18086 seconds to load)
1 example, 0 failures
</code></pre></div></div>

<h2 id="and-finally">And finally…</h2>
<p>As you can see Rspec is an easy tool to use. Don’t let testing intimidate you or hold you back from writing clean applications. While it will take more time to initially build your applications, you’ll find that you’ll be save a lot of time in the long run.</p>
