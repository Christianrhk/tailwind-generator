				Bitcoin DeFi works in different ways depending on the blockchain where it's deployed. Bitcoin DeFi built on Ethereum: To use Bitcoin on Ethereum, Bitcoin holders need to use a token such as Wrapped Bitcoin (WBTC). Wrapped Bitcoin is essentially a 1:1 representation of Bitcoin that can be used on other blockchains.			</p>

						<p>
				Defi may have gained its moniker on Ethereum, but it has now transcended that network and found a home on Bitcoin, where a number of smart contract platforms and protocols have been developed to leverage BTC's defi capabilities. In this guide, we'll look at some of these products and what they offer to developers and end-users.			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralized finance, or DeFi, is a catch-all term for financial products that live on decentralized networks like Ethereum. The basic idea of DeFi is to rely on smart contracts to automate financial products. The most widely used DeFi products currently are in the realm of borrowing and lending, trading, and derivatives.			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin is hands down the most well-known and widely used cryptocurrency. It has the highest market cap and has around 62.2% market dominance. Bitcoin still remains the original DeFi and with its massive, worldwide user base, its network effects are second to none. How do you use Bitcoin DeFi?			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin is not considered part of the current DeFi system. The majority of DeFi applications are built on the Ethereum network and Binance Smart Chain, while Bitcoin exists on its own blockchain. However, some DeFi dApps are starting to emerge on top of the Bitcoins blockchain.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi (or "decentralized finance") is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more — but it's faster and doesn't require paperwork or a third party.			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin DeFi ecosystem DeFi is the movement that leverages decentralized networks to transform old financial products into trustless and transparent protocols that run without intermediaries. We have 212 DeFi projects listed and 22 of them using Bitcoin. Asset Management Tools Eidoo			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi is focused on building decentralized applications that make it easier for people to use their money without relying on a third party, while Bitcoin is all about creating a new form of digital currency that can be used for transactions online.			</p>

						<p>
				We want to be clear that Bitcoin does not need DeFi. Bitcoin existed years before DeFi emerged and Bitcoin will remain should DeFi ever disappear. DeFi, however, needs Bitcoin; without the security and immutability unique to Bitcoin, DeFi will never achieve mass adoption. Only recently have we discovered bitcoin, the ultimate form of money.			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin is decentralized money, and if you're just starting out you may want to catch our " What is Bitcoin " video before moving forward. However, transferring money is only the first of many building blocks in a financial system. Aside from sending money to one another, there are a variety of services we use today.			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin as DeFi While Ethereum is top dog in the decentralized finance world, many proponents of Bitcoin share the goal of cutting the middleman out of more complex financial transactions, and...			</p>

						<p>
				While Bitcoin is a decentralized cryptocurrency—and the most popular one—DeFi is a concept that covers a range of financial services. Bitcoin is a store of value, much like fiat currency, that operates on its own blockchain. On the other hand, DeFi allows you to lend, borrow and trade cryptocurrencies, like Bitcoin, akin to quintessential ...			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralized finance, or "DeFi" for short, is an umbrella concept describing any financial services that are built on top of public blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. It also encompasses all ICO activity, which, at present, mostly takes place on Ethereum.			</p>

						<p>
				The amount of money locked on DeFi platforms has fallen from $170 billion at the start of April to around $60 billion today. Find out what that means for crypto investors.			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency. DeFi is being designed to use cryptocurrency in its ecosystem, so Bitcoin isn't DeFi as much as it is a part of it. What Is Total Value Locked in DeFi?			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin SB is the first bitcoin smart fork. A decentralized digital currency based on blockchain technology, powered by DeFi and designed to be the money for people. The original promise of Bitcoin meets DeFi and Velocity of Ethereum Network.			</p>

						<p>
				While DeFi Decentralized exchanges like Uniswap support hundreds of coins, Bitcoin is not one of them. You can't use Bitcoin as collateral or borrow funds to trade it on any of the DeFi exchanges or platforms. But why is that so? The root cause of this alienation of Bitcoin from the ongoing DeFi craze is the infrastructure.			</p>

						<p>
				The decentralized finance (defi) project's blog post adds: If you are looking for the exact amounts, the treasury holds 6,619,923.5 MIM and 10,380,153.06 CRV tokens.			</p>

						<p>
				The project, called "Bitcoin Odyssey" is led by Okcoin, Stacks Accelerator and Stacks Foundation. According to Okoin's website, "Bitcoin Odyssey comes as a response both to the big influx of investors DeFi has seen over 2021 and to the growth of the Stacks ecosystem and other smart contracts solutions built on top of Bitcoin.			</p>

						<p>
				Bitcoin price analysis is bearish today as we have seen more upside slowly tested and signs of rejection at the $21,000 mark. Therefore, BTC/USD should soon reverse and look to head back lower. If the $20,000 local support can be breached, a lot more downside will follow later in the week, with the next target being the $18,000 local swing low.			</p>

						<p>
				Since decentralized finance ( DeFi) first exploded in 2020, the majority of DeFi projects have been built on the Ethereum blockchain. Bitcoin holders who want to access DeFi have often chosen to use wrapped versions of Bitcoin such as WBTC. This has allowed them to use tokens pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin on blockchains such as Ethereum.			</p>

						<p>
				The defi space is growing in popularity, but it has also attracted a large number of crypto criminals in recent years. ... Bitcoin is poised to revolutionize the way individuals and companies do ...			</p>

						<p>
				Six days ago, Bitcoin.com reported on how defi and smart contract coins got slammed by significant blows and at the time, there was still $104 billion in value locked into a myriad of defi protocols.			</p>

						<p>
				The total DeFi TVL is currently sitting at $71.35 billion locked across all networks. Given that less than eight months ago, this number was at $250 billion, it has been an alarming decrease. The last time that the TVL had been this low was back in April of 2021 when the space was still picking up steam. This means that the DeFi TVL has dropped ...			</p>

				DeFi Coin (DEFC) is probing the 21-week levels around $0.12 after a 500% bounce from $0.10 to well over $0.50 in early May. The coin has continued to perform well over the last 24 hours, despite ...			</p>
