				Chainalysis has released its DeFi Adoption Index. The first thing that stands out is that, unlike with the Crypto Adoption Index, many of the countries ranking highest are those with high raw volumes of cryptocurrency value moved, both currently and historically.. DeFi adoption is being led by United States, China, Vietnam, the UK, and several other Western European countries.			</p>

						<p>
				The main difference between DeFi and CeFi is that the former involves decentralized infrastructures, where the financial services are governed by communities rather than single entities. In CeFi, all operations are managed by a business or a consortium of companies and organizations. Consequently, the mechanisms differ as well.			</p>

						<p>
				It has a further potential reach than stablecoins and a more diverse set of participants than DeFi - all major crypto exchanges itching for seignorage and every base-layer blockchain aiming to be the settlement layer.			</p>

						<p>
				What is Cryptocurrency? As its name suggests, cryptocurrency offers a digital medium of exchange. Cryptographic principles are used to store, transmit and secure these tokens. Once created, cryptocurrencies can be transferred among users on a public blockchain in a decentralised manner with privacy.			</p>

						<p>
				This decentralization doesn't just come out of anywhere, though - instead, DeFi is closely related to cryptocurrencies, or rather, the blockchain technology behind crypto. Blockchains are, primarily, decentralized. Yes, there are exceptions, but for the sake of keeping things simple and confusion-free, let's paint some things with a broad brush.			</p>

						<p>
				Another form of DeFi is the stablecoin. Cryptocurrencies often experience sharper price fluctuations than fiat, which isn't a good quality for people who want to know how much their money will be...			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi (or "decentralized finance") is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum. With DeFi, you can do most of the things that banks support — earn interest, borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade derivatives, trade assets, and more — but it's faster and doesn't require paperwork or a third party.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi means Decentralised Finance. DeFi operates using 'decentralised applications (DApps) that are built on existing cryptocurrency blockchain platforms such as Ethereum (ERC20) and Binance Smart Chain (BEP20).			</p>

						<p>
				Another significant difference between the two is that dApps leverage smart contracts, which, once launched, require a consensus to alter. dApps can run on a P2P network of computers, unlike DeFi, which is completely limited to blockchain networks. Final Thoughts It is no surprise that many people in the crypto space often confuse these two terms.			</p>

						<p>
				CeFi is also known for the facility of cross-chain services with the support for cryptocurrency trading. Users can ensure LTC to XRP or BTC to LTC conversions without depending on blockchain technology underlying different cryptocurrencies. On the other hand, DeFi is not capable of providing cross-chain services.			</p>

						<p>
				An unbeatable advantage of CeFi space over DeFi is that it supports fiat-to-crypto (and vice versa) transactions. Conversions between cryptocurrencies and fiat money usually involve the mediation of a centralized authority (such as a bank or a credit organization). However, DeFi exchanges generally do not offer such flexibility.			</p>

						<p>
				The founding principle behind DeFi is to implement 100 percent decentralization onto the finance and cryptocurrency ecosystems. One of the main differences between the two is that DeFi is open source while CeFi is not. Open source projects do not require permissions. Anyone with internet access is free to contribute.			</p>

						<p>
				Through DeFi lending, users can lend out cryptocurrency, like a traditional bank does with fiat currency, and earn interest as a lender. Borrowing and lending are among the most common use cases ...			</p>

						<p>
				There are also significant differences to know between CeFi and DeFi. 1. Centralization In a centralized finance environment, exchanges or trading platforms are owned by a single entity or often a corporation. They provide a variety of services to make crypto more accessible to their customers.			</p>

						<p>
				There are two areas where CeFi stands apart - One, wherein the CeFi exchanges enable the conversion of fiat currency to cryptocurrency and vice-versa in an easy and seamless manner and the other where it supports cross-chain exchange for multiple cryptocurrencies, thus displaying interoperability of cryptocurrencies.			</p>

						<p>
				With DeFi, users trust that the technology will function as intended to execute on services being offered. CeFi and DeFi both deliver a wide range of cryptocurrency-related financial services. The...			</p>

What adds to the appeal is very high market cap of nearly US$23 billion.			</p>
