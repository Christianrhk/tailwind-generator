To enable us to process Transactions for you, you authorize and direct us, our affiliates, the Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to receive and settle any payment processing proceeds owed to you through the Payment Processing Services. You appoint IntaSend as your agents for the limited purpose of directing, receiving, holding and settling such proceeds. You agree that IntaSend’s receipt of such proceeds satisfies the relevant end-customer’s obligations to make payments to you. We will promptly update your IntaSend Account balance to reflect any such proceeds that we receive on your behalf.</p><p data-block-key="qpfbj">Except where IntaSend and a Customer have otherwise agreed, you maintain the direct relationship with your Customers and are responsible for: (i) acquiring appropriate consent to submit Charges through the IntaSend Payment Processing Services on their behalf; (ii) providing confirmation or receipts to Customers for each Charge; (iii) verifying Customers’ identities; and (iv) determining a Customer’s eligibility and authority to complete Transactions. However, even authorized Transactions may be subject to a Dispute. IntaSend is not responsible for or liable to you for authorized and completed Charges that are later the subject of a Dispute, Refund, or Reversal, are submitted without authorization or in error, or violate any Laws.</p><p data-block-key="uw18x">You are immediately responsible to us for all Disputes, Refunds, Reversals, Returns, or Fines regardless of the reason or timing. We may decline to act upon a Refund instruction, or delay execution of the instruction, if: (i) it would cause your IntaSend Account balance to become negative; (ii) you are the subject of Bankruptcy Proceedings; or (iii) where we otherwise believe that there is a risk that you will not meet your liabilities under this Agreement (including with respect to the Charge that is the subject of the Refund instruction).</p><p data-block-key="xv7a3">In many but not all cases, you may have the ability to challenge a Dispute by submitting evidence through the API, Email, or Dashboard. We may request additional information to provide to Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers to assist you in contesting the Dispute, but we cannot guarantee that your challenge will be successful. Payment Method Providers and Payment Method Acquirers may deny your challenge for any reason they deem appropriate. You may not submit a new Charge which duplicates a Transaction that is subject to a Dispute.</p><p data-block-key="6pqk0">Please keep in mind that, as explained in <b>Section 5.0</b>, you are liable for all losses you incur when lost or stolen payment credentials or accounts are used to purchase products or services from you. IntaSend does not and will not insure you against losses caused by fraud under any circumstances. For example, if someone pretends to be a legitimate buyer but is a fraudster, you will be responsible for any resulting costs, including Disputes, even if you do not recover the fraudulently purchased product.</p><p data-block-key="mcluv">A Reversal for a Charge may be issued if the Charge is made without the account owner’s authorization or in connection with a Restricted Business, violates the applicable Payment Method Rules, or for other applicable reasons. If a Reversal is issued, we will provide you with a Notice and a description of the cause of the Reversal. Also, note that IntaSend&#x27;s fees that had already been charged during the processing of the transaction are not reversible.</p><h3 data-block-key="fh3lv"><b>4.0 Responsibilities and Disclosures to Your Customers</b></h3><p data-block-key="2ht2q">It is very important to us that your Customers understand the purpose, amount, and conditions of Charges you submit to us. With that in mind, when using the IntaSend Payment Processing Services you agree to: (i) accurately communicate, and not misrepresent, the nature of the Transaction, and the amount of the Charge in the appropriate currency prior to submitting it to the API; (ii) provide a receipt that accurately describes each Transaction to Customers; (iii) provide Customers a meaningful way to contact you in the event that the product or service is not provided as described; (iv) not use Services to sell products or services in a manner that is unfair or deceptive, exposes Customers to unreasonable risks, or does not disclose material terms of a purchase in advance; and (v) inform Customers that IntaSend and its affiliates process Transactions (including payment Transactions) for you. You also agree to maintain and make available to your Customers a fair and neutral return, refund, cancellation, or adjustment policy, and clearly explain the process by which Customers can receive a Refund.</p><p data-block-key="j17cq">The IntaSend Payment Processing Services may include functionality that enables you to receive recurring or subscription payments from your Customers, and to issue invoices to your Customers. If you use the Payment Processing Services to submit recurring or subscription Charges, you agree to comply with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules, including clearly informing Customers in advance of submitting the initial Charge that they will be charged on an ongoing basis and explaining the method for unsubscribing or cancelling their recurring billing or subscription. If you use the IntaSend Payment Processing Services to issue invoices to your Customers, you understand and agree that it is your responsibility to ensure that the form and content of the invoices comply with applicable Laws, and are sufficient to achieve any legal or tax effect that you are trying to achieve.</p><p data-block-key="rzo40">If you engage in Transactions with Customers who are individuals (i.e. consumers), you specifically agree to provide consumers disclosures required by Law, and to not engage in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices.</p><h3 data-block-key="zj6v8"><b>5. Security and Fraud Controls</b></h3><p data-block-key="628j0"><b>5.1 IntaSend’s Security</b></p><p data-block-key="nuraj">IntaSend is responsible for protecting the security of Data in our possession. We will maintain commercially reasonable administrative, technical, and physical procedures to protect User Data and Personal Data stored in our servers from unauthorized access, accidental loss, modification, or breach, and we will comply with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules when we handle User and Personal Data. However, no security system is impenetrable and we cannot guarantee that unauthorized parties will never be able to defeat our security measures or misuse any Data in our possession. You provide User Data and Personal Data to IntaSend with the understanding that any security measures we provide may not be appropriate or adequate for your business, and you agree to implement Security Controls (as defined below) and any additional controls that meet your specific requirements. In our sole discretion, we may take any action, including suspension of your IntaSend Account, to maintain the integrity and security of the Services or Data, or to prevent harm to you, us, Customers, or others. You waive any right to make a claim against us for losses you incur that may result from such actions.</p><p data-block-key="xy0n0"><b>5.2 Your Security</b></p><p data-block-key="978nh">You are solely responsible for the security of any Data on your website, your servers, in your possession, or that you are otherwise authorized to access or handle. You will comply with applicable Laws and Payment Method Rules when handling or maintaining User Data and Personal Data, and will provide evidence of your compliance to us upon our request. If you do not provide evidence of such compliance to our satisfaction, we may suspend your IntaSend Account or terminate this Agreement.</p><p data-block-key="66abz"><b>5.3. Security Controls</b></p><p data-block-key="fkz91">You are responsible for assessing the security requirements of your business, and selecting and implementing security procedures and controls (“Security Controls”) appropriate to mitigate your exposure to security incidents. We may provide Security Controls as part of the Services, or suggest that you implement specific Security Controls. However, your responsibility for securing your business is not diminished by any Security Controls that we provide or suggest, and if you believe that the Security Controls we provide are insufficient, then you must separately implement additional controls that meet your requirements. You may review some of the details of our Security Controls <a href="https://intasend.com/security">on our website</a>.</p><p data-block-key="bjzm8"><b>5.4 Fraud Risk</b></p><p data-block-key="qb1gj">While we may provide or suggest Security Controls, we cannot guarantee that you or Customers will never become victims of fraud. Any Security Controls we provide or suggest may include processes or applications developed by IntaSend, its affiliates, or other companies. You agree to review all the Security Controls we suggest and choose those that are appropriate for your business to protect against unauthorized Transactions and, if appropriate for your business, independently implement other security procedures and controls not provided by us. If you disable or fail to properly use Security Controls, you will increase the likelihood of unauthorized Transactions, Disputes, fraud, losses, and other similar occurrences. Keep in mind that you are solely responsible for losses you incur from the use of lost or stolen payment credentials or accounts by fraudsters who engage in fraudulent Transactions with you, and your failure to implement Security Controls will only increase the risk of fraud. We may assist you with recovering lost funds, but you are solely responsible for losses due to lost or stolen credentials or accounts, compromise of your username or password, changes to your Settlement Account, and any other unauthorized use or modification of your IntaSend Account. IntaSend is not liable or responsible to you and you waive any right to bring a claim against us for any losses that result from the use of lost or stolen credentials or unauthorized use or modification of your IntaSend Account, unless such losses result from IntaSend’s willful or intentional actions. Further, you will fully reimburse us for any losses we incur that result from the use of lost or stolen credentials or accounts.</p><p data-block-key="nsa0o">We may also provide you with Data regarding the possibility or likelihood that a Transaction may be fraudulent. We may incorporate any subsequent action or inaction by you into our fraud model, for the purpose of identifying future potential fraud. You understand that we provide this Data to you for your consideration, but that you are ultimately responsible for any actions you choose to take or not take in relation to such Data.</p><p data-block-key="d2wlu"><b>5.5 Account Security and Two Factor Authentication (“2FA”)</b></p><p data-block-key="ti4wy">2FA is an additional layer of security we have added to your account. When 2FA is enabled, you will be required to enter a One Time Password (OTP) (which is a verification code we have sent to you for authentication purposes), each time you checkout using IntaSend on a merchant’s website or platform. OTP is also required in account login and other authorizations. While we encourage you to enable this feature on every transaction, you may choose to disable the 2FA feature after your initial enrolmen. However, if you choose to disable this feature, you agree that IntaSend shall not be liable for any loss or damages incurred as a result of your action.</p><h3 data-block-key="ou47e"><b>6.0 Settlement and Payout Schedule</b></h3><p data-block-key="tssmi"><b>6.1 Your Settlement Account</b></p><p data-block-key="ferq5">IntaSend will, with its banking partners, arrange to settle funds to the bank or other financial institution account that you designate (your “Settlement Account”). You affirm that you are authorized to initiate settlements to and debits from the Settlement Account, and that the Settlement Account is owned by you, titled in your legal or trade name, and administered and managed by a financial institution located in Kenya. If you update your Settlement Account (including via the Dashboard) then you must ensure that you continue to comply with the requirements of this section. We may require you to provide us with documentary proof demonstrating your compliance with this section, and your failure to provide such proof will constitute a breach of this Agreement.</p><p data-block-key="m94gm"><b>6.2 Settlement to Your Settlement Account</b></p><p data-block-key="ffy8s">Only a positive balance in your IntaSend Account will result in settlement to your Settlement Account. We may reduce the amount settled to your Settlement Account by the amount of Fees, Fines, and amounts owed to us for any reason.</p><p data-block-key="llt89"><b>6.3 Settlement to third party recipients (B2C Disbursement)</b></p><p data-block-key="s0lka">We may offer you the ability to have funds settled to another person (a “third party recipient”) through the Business to Customer disbursement service through Mobile Money Providers, instead of settling funds to your Payout Account. When doing this, it is your responsibility to ensure that the beneficiary details e.g Mobile Number is correct before initiating the B2C service. We will promptly update your IntaSend Account balance to reflect such settlement or transfer.</p><p data-block-key="p7n7m"><b>6.4 Multi-currency Processing</b></p><p data-block-key="jsise">We may offer you the ability to have funds settled to your Settlement Account in a currency different from the one in which you accepted payment from a customer (“Multi-Currency Processing”). To use this service, you must provide us with a valid Settlement Account for each currency for which you request settlement, based on our list of available settlement currencies. We may add or remove currencies from our list of available settlement currencies at any time. If you use Multi-Currency Processing, we will identify at the time of the Charge (for example, through the API), the conversion rate that will apply to the Charge. If you Refund a Charge, the conversion rate that will apply will be the rate in effect at the time of the Refund, not the Charge. By submitting a Charge or Refund you will be deemed to have accepted the applicable conversion rate. You may choose not to use the Multi-Currency Processing service at any time. You may also change the Settlement Account information or other settings associated with your use of Multi-Currency Processing, but any such changes will only affect subsequent Charges.</p><p data-block-key="8u1sp"><b>6.5 Payout Schedule</b></p><p data-block-key="mlv6o">The term “Payout Schedule” refers to the time it takes for us to initiate settlement to your Settlement Account. Your Payout Schedule may be specified in the Dashboard. IntaSend may require a holding period before making initial settlement to the IntaSend Account. After the initial settlement of funds, we will settle funds to the IntaSend Account according to the Payout Schedule; however, please be aware that a Payment Method Provider, a Payment Method Acquirer, or the financial institution holding your Settlement Account, may delay settlement for any reason. We are not responsible for any action taken by the institution holding your Settlement Account to not credit the Settlement Account or to otherwise not make funds available to you as you expected.</p><p data-block-key="7d0sr">We reserve the right to change the Payout Schedule or to suspend settlement to you. Examples of situations where we may do so are: (i) where there are pending, anticipated, or excessive Disputes, Refunds, or Reversals; (ii) in the event that we suspect or become aware of suspicious activity; or (iii) where we are required by Law or court order. We have the right to withhold settlement to your Settlement Account upon termination of this Agreement if we reasonably determine that we may incur losses resulting from credit, fraud, or other legal risks associated with your IntaSend Account. If we exercise our right to withhold a Settlement for any reason, we will communicate the general reason for withholding the Settlement and give you a timeline for releasing the funds.</p><p data-block-key="ivgj3"><b>6.6 Incorrect Settlement</b></p><p data-block-key="33xjf">The information required for settlement will depend on the financial institution holding the Payout Account. Please make sure that any information about the Settlement Accounts that you provide to us is accurate and complete. If you provide us with incorrect information (i) you understand that funds may be settled to the wrong account and that we may not be able to recover the funds from such incorrect transactions and (ii) you agree that you are solely responsible for any losses you or third parties incur due to erroneous settlement transactions, you will not make any claims against us related to such erroneous settlement transactions, and you will fully reimburse us for any losses we incur.</p><h3 data-block-key="ifnzo"><b>7.0 Charges</b></h3><p data-block-key="92efz">In consideration of us providing the Services, you must pay our charges (“Charges”) in accordance with this clause 7.</p><p data-block-key="ek3ht">The Charges are the prices quoted on the Site at the time you sign up or as quoted to you by the relevant member of our sales team. We take all reasonable care to ensure that the prices stated for the Services are correct at the time when the relevant information was entered into the system. We reserve the right to increase or decrease the Charges or usage levels at any time.</p><p data-block-key="qeaq1">Our Charges are exclusive of VAT and any other applicable sales tax. Where VAT, or other applicable sales tax, is payable in respect of some or all of the Services you must pay us such additional amounts in respect of VAT, or other applicable sales tax, at the applicable rate, at the same time as you pay the Charges.</p><h3 data-block-key="4ifj0"><b>8.0 Payment Processor</b></h3><p data-block-key="rks0m">IntaSend uses a third-party payment processor (the “Payment Processor”) to allow for payments on the IntaSend Service. The processing of payments or credits, as applicable, in connection with your use of the IntaSend Service will be subject to the terms, conditions, and privacy policies of the Payment Processor in addition to this Agreement. IntaSend is not responsible for any errors by the Payment Processor.</p><h3 data-block-key="z9swu"><b>9.0 Disclaimer</b></h3><p data-block-key="ctmi4">Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services are the sole responsibility of the person from whom such Content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it.</p><p data-block-key="abhvp">We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services.
