            <h1 class="title">Terms of Service ("Terms")</h1>
            <p>Please read these Terms of Service ("Terms", "Terms of Service")
                carefully before using the <a href="https://www.featuremonkey.com/"><span
                        style="font-weight: 400;">https://www.featuremonkey.com/</a><span style="font-weight: 400;">
                    website (the "Service") operated by Feature Monkey Inc ("us", "we", or
                    "our").</p>
            <p>Your access to and use of the Service is conditioned upon your acceptance
                of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users and others who wish to
                access or use the Service.</p>
            <p><strong>By accessing or using the Service you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any
                    part of the terms then you do not have permission to access the Service.</strong></p>
            <h2><strong>Communications</strong></h2>
            <p>By creating an Account on our service, you agree to subscribe to
                newsletters, marketing or promotional materials and other information we may send. However, you may
                opt out of receiving any, or all, of these communications from us by following the unsubscribe link
                or instructions provided in any email we send.</p>
            <h2><strong>Subscriptions</strong></h2>
            <p>Some parts of the Service are billed on a subscription basis
                ("Subscription(s)"). You will be billed in advance on a recurring and periodic basis ("Billing
                Cycle"). Billing cycles are set either on a monthly or annual basis, depending on the type of
                subscription plan you select when purchasing a Subscription.</p>
            <p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically
                renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or Feature Monkey Inc cancels it. You may
                cancel your Subscription renewal by contacting Feature Monkey Inc customer support team.</p>
            <p>A valid payment method, including credit card, is required to process the
                payment for your Subscription. You shall provide Feature Monkey Inc with accurate and complete
                billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid
                payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize
                Feature Monkey Inc to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment
                instruments.</p>
            <p>Should automatic billing fail to occur for any reason, Feature Monkey Inc
                will issue an electronic invoice indicating that you must proceed manually, within a certain
                deadline date, with the full payment corresponding to the billing period as indicated on the
                invoice.</p>
            <h2><strong>Free Trial</strong></h2>
            <p>Feature Monkey Inc may, at its sole discretion, offer a Subscription with
                a free trial for a limited period of time ("Free Trial").</p>
            <p>You may be required to enter your billing information in order to sign up
                for the Free Trial.</p>
            <p>If you do enter your billing information when signing up for the Free
                Trial, you will not be charged by Feature Monkey Inc until the Free Trial has expired. On the last
                day of the Free Trial period, unless you cancelled your Subscription, you will be automatically
                charged the applicable Subscription fees for the type of Subscription you have selected.</p>
            <p>At any time and without notice, Feature Monkey Inc reserves the right to
                (i) modify the terms and conditions of the Free Trial offer, or (ii) cancel such Free Trial
                offer.</p>
            <h2><strong>Fee Changes</strong></h2>
            <p>Feature Monkey Inc, in its sole discretion and at any time, may modify
                the Subscription fees for the Subscriptions. Any Subscription fee change will become effective at
                the end of the then-current Billing Cycle.</p>
            <p>Feature Monkey Inc will provide you with a reasonable prior notice of any
                change in Subscription fees to give you an opportunity to terminate your Subscription before such
                change becomes effective.</p>
            <p>Your continued use of the Service after the Subscription fee change comes
                into effect constitutes your agreement to pay the modified Subscription fee amount.</p>
            <h2><strong>Refunds</strong></h2>
            <p>Certain refund requests for Subscriptions may be considered by Feature
                Monkey Inc on a case-by-case basis and granted in sole discretion of Feature Monkey Inc.</p>
