				The two most prominent trends in the existing crypto market refer to DeFi and NFTs. Decentralized finance and non-fungible tokens are presently the two most popular applications in the domain of blockchain technology. DeFi offers decentralized access to financial services while non-fungible tokens focus on enabling tokenization of assets.			</p>

						<p>
				NFT Ownership and DeFi The use of Defi platforms ingrained with NFTs in the music industry is a revolution for artists. NFT plays a very significant role in facilitating ownership rights and profits to the original creators. Those who own the NFTs will earn a fair share of the streaming revenue yielded by the songs.			</p>

						<p>
				It's certainly one aspect to enable more NFT DeFi. If you combine NFT staking, lending, and renting, you can potentially create some exciting revenue streams for your previously illiquid NFTs. Overall, the goal of NFT DeFi is to make NFTs more liquid and allow users to access more capital to spend on DeFi protocols and other blockchain services.			</p>

						<p>
				The Visor Finance protocol contains modular components that enable active asset management within Defi protocols. It enables users to mint and store assets in an NFT vault. The vault assets can interact with specific hypervisors and supervisors. It connects your Visor assets to external Defi protocols for a wide range of applications.			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi is primarily used to conduct business transactions with virtual money. NFTs are the more widely known virtual asset type. The acronym stands for "non-fungible token," which basically means that it's an asset that you can't physically hold. The most common NFTs are images, whether they are art or digital collectibles.			</p>

						<p>
				A BIG reason DeFi is so powerful is due to overhead. In business, overhead is expenses, and the fewer expenses you have the better. Regular banks have buildings to pay for, electricity, employees ...			</p>

						<p>
				NFTs stand for non-fungible tokens and they are one of the types of cryptographic tokens that can represent ownership of digitally scarce goods such as pieces of art or collectibles. "Non-fungible" is not a very popular word so let's see what it really means.			</p>

						<p>
				In a few simple steps, MyNFT.fyi allows you to quickly verify ownership of your NFT profile image (or any other NFT) by entering your Opensea NFT URL and signing off with your Ethereum address.

						<p>
				Non Fungible Tokens, or NFTs, are unique and irreplaceable cryptographic tokens that represent a physical or digital asset. NFTs can represent anything ranging from art pieces, properties, achievements, trophies, unique video game items, digital IDs, or even domain names.			</p>

						<p>
				Indassety wants to give NFTs more usecases in order to get more value out of holding an NFT. NFT-DeFi is the way to do so. Since NFTs have a determinable value, they could be borrowed/lent, staked and used as collateral for a loan (just like cryptocurrencies).

						<p>
				An NFT is the tokenized version of a non-fungible asset. Instead of a fiat currency like USD, AUD, or GBP, these tokens may represent an artwork, real estate, or collectibles. Popular digital games, such as Decentraland and CryptoKitties, frequently leverage these tokens. NFTs are developed on the ERC-721 protocol.			</p>

						<p>
				NFT or non-fungible tokens have been around for several years but became widely known only at the end of 2020 and early 2021.
