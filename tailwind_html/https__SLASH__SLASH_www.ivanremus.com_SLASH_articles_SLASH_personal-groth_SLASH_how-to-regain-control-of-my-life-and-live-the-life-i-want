<h1>How to regain control of your life and live the life you want</h1>
<div class="text-sm text-grey-2 mt-3 mb-10">Feb 20, 2022</div>
<div><p>We all want to be in control of our lives. We want to make decisions that will help us achieve our goals and live the life we want. However, sometimes it feels like outside forces are controlling us, and we can't seem to break free. This can be especially true for our careers and personal lives. If this sounds like you, don't worry - you're not alone. In this blog post, we will discuss how you can regain control of your life and live the life you want!</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796479_Regain control of your life.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>How does lack of control make you feel?</h2><p>A lack of control can lead to feelings of anxiety and stress for many people. You may feel like you're constantly on edge and that you're not in charge of your own life. This can be extremely frustrating and overwhelming and leave you feeling hopeless and helpless.</p><p><br></p><p>You might feel stuck in your life. It can be hard to make decisions if you don't feel like you have any control over them.</p><p><br></p><p>You might not know what direction or how far to go in your life. You may want a change but aren't sure where to start or how long it'll take to get there!</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796501_How does lack of control make you feel.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Start by assessing your situation.</h2><p>If you want to regain control of your life and live the life you want, then you must step back and look at your life from a broader perspective. You need to figure out what you value most in life and what you want to accomplish with your life. Life is not meant to be lived in quiet desperation; it is meant to be lived with enthusiasm and passion.</p><p><br></p><p>Your present situation can be assessed in a number of ways, but I'd say the most effective would be through a positive attitude and a willingness to learn.</p><p><br></p><p>To achieve an optimal level of self-control, it is essential that you keep a vigilant eye on the most critical aspects of your life. On a scale of 1 to 10, how do you consider is your:</p><ol><li><strong>Health. </strong>How is your physical and emotional health? How do you feel about yourself, and how does your body look and feel?</li><li><strong>Finances (money). </strong>How are you doing financially? How much debt do you have, and what is your net worth?</li><li><strong>Relationships (love). </strong>How are your relationships with family, friends, and romantic partners? How supportive are they, and do you feel like you can be yourself around them?</li><li><strong>Career. </strong>How is your career progressing? Are you satisfied with your current job, or are you looking for something new?</li><li><strong>Intellectual / Education.</strong> How is your educational progress? Have you been</li><li><strong>Spiritual. </strong>How connected are you to something larger than yourself? How much do you believe in a higher power, and how does that impact your life?</li></ol><p><br></p><p>We have put together an easy assessment to help you in this important first step toward regaining control over your life.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796524_Start by assessing your situation.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Respond instead of reacting</h2><p>It's not always easy to control anything. You are free of any interference with your response in your own mind. Having control requires understanding emotions and handling the reaction. So change from reaction to reaction. Reactions have emotions. Taking an action involves emotions. What makes this different is that reactions happen when a person's behavior is influenced by beliefs, biases, or prejudice. A reaction occurs instantly in unconsciousness without thought. It's aimed to survive and can sometimes serve to protect against threats. When we begin processing emotions, we act.</p><p><br></p><p>Assuming you observe a rapid reaction you will take actions that conform to your values.</p><p><br></p><h2>Unpack emotional triggers</h2><p>To loosen emotions you must understand how the feelings came to be. Think about your emotional response like breadcrumbs, which take you to the place where your attention must be. We all react differently to emotions and we can learn from them. These may be derived from childhood experiences. If parents leave you early in life you may have developed the fear that rejection may happen later in life. Regaining control involves overcoming these circumstances and modifying your story as you progress. It's essential that we go beyond our current selves. The conditions underpinning our decisions should be addressed in order to achieve the desired outcome.</p><p><br></p><h2>What can you do to regain control?</h2><p>There are many things you can do to regain control of your life. First, it's important that you identify the areas where lack of control is affecting you most severely - these are usually related to work or personal relationships and finances. Once identified, take some time each day for yourself: go on walks in nature; read books about topics which interest you (such as history); spend time with family and friends; exercise regularly - anything that helps to relax your mind and body! Your goal should be to regain control by identifying these things so they don't have power over you anymore.</p><p>This process doesn't happen overnight. It may take some time before you feel like yourself again. Be patient with this process and remember that everything happens at its own pace as long as we keep trying!</p><p><br></p><p>There are two ways to achieve true happiness and fulfillment. One way is to focus on your world without, which means focusing on the material things, such as buying expensive cars, houses, and clothes. This approach leads to feelings of insecurity and dissatisfaction because you never feel satisfied.</p><p><br></p><p>The other way is to focus on your world within and your spiritual values, such as love, compassion, and gratitude. This approach leads to inner peace and satisfaction because you always feel fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><h2>Identify internal vs external motivations</h2><p>When you tell yourself that life is not under control, you may think you are on the train and going somewhere that wasn't where you wanted. Are we driving? It is necessary to distinguish internal motivations and reconcile them to external influences in order to make things right. Motivational factors originate at the core of the organization. It's all the heart desires that bring passion to your soul. Your wishes are your own. Its determination depends on your values. External motivation can originate primarily within you. It refers to the expectations or objectives of your parents, spouse, or friend.</p><p><br></p><h2>Clarify your core values and beliefs</h2><p>There is always a message we receive that shows how good success is. If you follow everyone's dreams, you have a thousand different options for you to follow in a certain direction. You have to find what you are truly wanting. Here are my values. You define what you are. It's your foundation for growing your confidence. When one discovers their values, he will know what is truly true. Studies have confirmed that you should know the beliefs you believe in. It's likely that family, service, and community are the best parts of your life.</p><p><br></p><h2>Implement a daily planning routine</h2><p>When your schedule is crowded, it can make it very frustrating for you. Getting control over our most important tasks can give you a sense of control over our lives. Daily planning keeps your mind occupied with your needs. This helps to stay organized, eliminating the temptation to get involved in unimportant tasks. Creating routine according to priority. Plan the day for optimum energy levels. Have we ever slept early? Start your morning early and dedicate your first hour to your most important work. You may be able to block the afternoon for a moment. Here's another tip: you can create a calendar where you write down all of your appointments and tasks for the week. This will allow us to see at a glance what needs doing so that nothing slips through cracks!</p><p>Success in life requires us to stay focused and establish a daily routine of meditation, exercise, family time, self-awareness, and visualization of what it is like to live a meaningful life.</p><p><br></p><p>Your morning routine will set the pace for the rest of your day. Do not open your emails, do not read the news, do not check your text messages in the morning as soon as you wake up. Flash news, you don't need to answer every text message that you receive. By spending time in the morning checking your cellphone and your emails, you are allowing others to impose on you their own agendas instead of you deciding what it's important for you.</p><p><br></p><h2>Concentrate on the most important tasks.</h2><p>Focus on one thing at a time, rather than juggling too many balls in the air. You may feel like there's no way out of control. When we focus on too many things at once, our attention is divided and this can lead to mistakes. This also leaves us feeling overwhelmed and stressed out. By focusing on one task at a time, you're able to give it your full attention which will help you to complete it successfully.</p><p><br></p><p>It is very common to feel anxious and overwhelmed when we try to do too many things at the same time. That is why having a to-do list without prioritizing it is a waste of time. Besides, you are sending the wrong signal to your subconscious mind. That your goals are not worth to fulfill.</p><p><br></p><p>Life is always going to throw curveballs at us, but that doesn't mean we have to let them affect us negatively. We can regain control of our lives by following these simple tips!</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796549_Concentrate on the most important tasks.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Take personal responsibility</h2><p>When we get back control of our lives, we must find the balance between the things we cannot. It's about recognizing your control and taking total accountability in all aspects. You should take good care of your behavior so you can change them accordingly. Do you really care about what happened to you in your life? Not to punish yourself, but to seek what can be changed. Make a good list of the things that happen to you every day! Some people do things wrong. Take time for reflection to remember that life is learning. We will continue to evolve.</p><p><br></p><h2>Set boundaries</h2><p>It's very important to set boundaries for ourselves, as this will help us to stay in control. If we don't do it, others may take advantage of us and we'll end up feeling overwhelmed and stressed. By setting clear boundaries, it makes it easier for others to understand what is acceptable behavior and what isn't. This also helps to protect our mental health!</p><p><br></p><h3>To have more control, we must learn to say no.</h3><p>You cannot take care of others if you cannot take care of yourself first. You need to learn how to say "no" and stop trying so hard for everyone's sake. The world will not end when someone else is disappointed because we did not do what they wanted us to do. It's important to remember that we cannot please everyone and that's okay!</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796573_Set boundarie.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Believe that you can: Overcome limiting beliefs</h2><p>Almost all individuals engage in dialog. These inner voices can affect various psychological functions such as reading, writing, thinking, memory, self-reflexive, and problem-solving, according to a report published in "Psychology Bulletin". What's the flavor in self-talk? What is your inner voice saying? "You are not good enough. You cannot make it. Keep a low profile. These kinds of limited thinking often originate from the early years of our lives. It sounds like your parents did not offer any praise to you. That kid from class waited so long for you.</p><p><br></p><h2>Make a plan of action (with tiny steps)</h2><p>Many of us talk of our dreams but never actually act. Often we wait until inspiration comes. In fact, inspiration comes from a person. It'll be a challenge to get started on something. Imagine your dreams! Find your way back.</p><p><br></p><p>How should I start taking small steps toward achieving my goal? The goal becomes easier to achieve if the chunk is smaller in size. Take the next step and gradually work towards it. It may take ten to write your book. You may want to do some exercise at least once daily.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796604_Make a plan of action.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Deliberate then act</h2><p>People who lack agency encounter common impediments to making sound decision-making. They are sometimes irritable or anxious. They may have a bad feeling or they may lack confidence if they are not careful, they think in logical ways or they think fast. Choosing to go on the move is a crucial decision that needs to take place first.</p><p>Give yourself time to explore a space where it will give you time to relax because it should be safe. Keep focusing on what matters most to you.</p><p><br></p><h2>What are the benefits of being in control?</h2><p>There are many benefits to being in control of your life. For example, when you feel like everything around is out-of-control and it seems impossible for anything to ever change that - it actually helps reduce stress levels!</p><p><br></p><p>You'll also have more energy because there won't be any need to constantly worry about what's going on; less anxiety since you're not worried about what might come next; better sleep quality (which helps with all of these other things too!).</p><p><br></p><h2>Why is control so important?</h2><p>You may think that being out of control isn't a big deal, but it can have serious consequences. For example, if someone is constantly worried about their finances they may be too stressed to focus on their work, which can lead to them losing their job.</p><p>Feeling like you're constantly out of control can also have a negative impact on your mental health and well-being, so it's important to take steps to regain control as soon as possible!</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, in our pursuit of success and money, we lose focus on finding a work-life balance, affecting our personal life. This could be due to the demanding job, or social life and leaves us feeling drained by the end of the day.</p><p><br></p><h2>How can we achieve a work-life balance?</h2><p>It is possible to achieve a work-life balance, but it takes effort and commitment. You have to be willing to make changes in your life, such as setting boundaries with your family and friends, saying no more often, and delegating.</p><p>You also need to find time for yourself outside of work by taking up a hobby or exercise, which will help you relax and de-stress. Finally, try to change your mindset about work-life balance - it's not a perfect 50/50 split, but more of a juggling act where some things will be more important at certain times than others.</p><p><br></p><p>It seems very common to find ourselves trapped working long hours just to get some extra money. This leaves us feeling exhausted and is not a healthy way to live.</p><p><br></p><h3>How do we break this cycle?</h3><p>There are many ways to break the cycle of working long hours for extra money. For example, you could negotiate a raise with your boss, start freelancing on the side or find a new job that pays more. You might decide to create a side business.</p><p><br></p><p>The key is to find what works for you and stick with it - there's no one-size-fits-all solution here.</p><p><br></p><p>Sometimes, in our pursuit of success and money, we lose focus on finding a work-life balance, affecting our personal life.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796625_Achieve a work-life balance.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Make new friends</h2><p>Meet someone who shares your interests - especially those that are not your current friends. The activity can easily be found on <a href="https://facebook.com/" target="_blank">Facebook</a> or <a href="https://meetup.com/" target="_blank">meet-up</a> websites. Too often people find themselves doing things others are not doing and have no idea.</p><p><br></p><p>As soon as people understand that you've made new friends, your community will become an oasis of freedom. Your social life can affect your health greatly.</p><p><br></p><p>Having a social life helps to improve health and wellbeing. However, unhealthy relatives influence you to become unhealthy too.</p><p><br></p><p>Relationships influence us in many ways. Healthy relationships help us to feel good about ourselves. We can also share our ideas with others and learn from their experiences. However, unhealthy relationships influence you to become unhealthy.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796646_Make new friends.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Make your health a priority</h2><p>Sometimes it's easy to forget about your health because you're busy with other things. It's important for us to make time for ourselves so we can focus on our health.</p><p><br></p><p>There are many things we can do to make sure our health is a priority, such as eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep. Taking care of your health should be a top priority if you want to live a happy and healthy life!</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796664_Make your health a priority.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Take time to rest</h2><p>What is the best way to do this without leaving home? Take time off from work. Do not call in sick and go out with friends instead of clocking in at your desk.</p><p><br></p><p>Rest is important for a healthy lifestyle. It helps you feel energized and refreshed. This can help you to get more done and be less stressed.</p><p><br></p><p>The most important alarm to set is not the time to get put but the time you should go to bed to guarantee that you have enough time to rest and recover.</p><p><br></p><p>Most people believe that part of being successful is to hustle all day long and sacrifice your time to recover. Nothing could be more wrong.</p><p><br></p><p>Successful people know the importance of taking the time every day to recover so they can be more effective during their busy hours.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796684_Take time to rest.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Move on</h2><p>Getting enough rest helps to restore body balance and gives you more power, energy, and endurance. It is also advisable to take breaks from intense periods of active activity to stretch yourself out.</p><p><br></p><p>Studies show exercise increases self-control (a capacity to delay gratification) and exercise helps to improve the quality of life and well-being, which is crucial in living a healthy lifestyle.</p><p><br></p><p>Set the time on your desk so that the alarm is turned off at the end of the workday. If you feel overwhelmed, you have to step on.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796705_Move on.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Take time off to exercise</h2><p>Even if you are feeling tired, it helps to get up and move. Instead of turning on Netflix or going online shopping, try something new. How about going for a walk?</p><p><br></p><p>One great activity I like to do is running, especially on weekends when I have time to myself. This way, I can enjoy nature and take a break from my usual routine.</p><p><br></p><h2>Go for a walk.</h2><p>Walking is a great way to stay active, but it's also a great way to clear your head and relax. If you don't have time to go for a walk during the day, try going for a walk at night.</p><p>A bonus of taking time to exercise is that you will probably lose weight. This is a great way to regain control of your life and live the life you want! Just make sure you are safe while exercising, especially at night.</p><p><br></p><h2>Read books</h2><p>Reading is a great way to unwind after long days at work or school. How about reading for pleasure? How about taking some time off on weekends? How about trying new recipes in the kitchen? How about catching up on your favorite TV series? How about all of the above?</p><p><br></p><p>The important thing is to find something that relaxes you and makes you happy. It's crucial to take time for yourself, especially if you're feeling overwhelmed or stressed out. Just remember: it's not always easy to find a work-life balance, but it is worth it. How do you balance your work and life? How do you make sure that both are working in harmony together? What tips can you share with others who struggle to find this balance as well?</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796725_Read books.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Try new things</h2><p>When we get into a routine, it's hard to break out of it. But by trying new things, you can open yourself up to new opportunities and experiences. How about signing up for a dance class, cooking class, or painting class? How about going on a weekend trip with friends or family? How about learning a new language? How about trying a new hobby?</p><p>The key is to keep your mind and body active, which will help you to live a happier and healthier life. What are some things you've always wanted to do but haven't gotten around to doing yet? How about making a list and trying to check off as many items as possible? How about giving yourself a deadline and getting started on each item as soon as possible? How about coming up with an action plan and following through on it? How about making a commitment to yourself and sticking to it?</p><p>The bottom line is that you should do what makes you feel happy and fulfilled.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796741_Try new things.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Practice mindfulness meditation</h2><p>Mindfulness meditation is a great way to bring your mind and body back into balance. How about taking some time off on weekends? How about downloading an app that allows you to practice mindfulness meditation in the comfort of your own home?</p><p><br></p><p>Create the habit of setting aside ten minutes each morning to meditate. Do you feel like there is not enough time to meditate in the morning? Try to wake up some minutes early. How about doing this at night before bed?</p><p><br></p><p>You gain clarity through purposeful meditation and visualization. But, this practice cannot be the product of a burst reaction. It must be practiced as a daily habit.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796757_Practice mindfulness meditation.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>It's also important to create the habit of positive self-talk.</h2><p>The key is to be kind to yourself, which will help you to live a more balanced and happier life. Try making a list of affirmations and repeating them to yourself every morning or at night before bed.</p><p><br></p><p>Create a vision board/journal and write down all the things that you want to achieve that make you happy, grateful, excited for the future, etc. Pick one item from the list and work on it until it's completed. Set some goals for yourself and work towards them each day. How about making a commitment to yourself and sticking to it?</p><p><br></p><p>There are many things you can do to regain control of your life and live the life you want. The bottom line is that you should decide to make a change and follow through on it.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796772_Create the habit of positive self-talk.webp"></p><p><br></p><h2>Live in the present moment.</h2><p>The present moment is all we have, and by living in it, we can enjoy life to the fullest. Take a few minutes each day to focus on your breath. Focus on the sounds around you. Feel the sun or wind on your skin. How about savoring a delicious meal or drink?</p><p><br></p><p>Taking control of your life is more about taking control of your emotions and less about trying to control variables that are outside of your control anyway.</p><p><br></p><p>By taking control over your emotions and daily routines, and letting go of all the aspects of your life that you do not control, like other people's actions and feelings, you stop instantly feeling anxious and feel more in control of your life.</p><p><br></p><p>The easiest way to feel like you are losing control over your life is to waste energy trying to control others.</p><p><br></p><p>Remember, life means change. Be prepared to confront and accept changes in your life. Otherwise, you will constantly face strong emotions that might cause more harm than good.</p><p><br></p><p>Most people fear change, but if you embrace it and take action, it can be a powerful tool to help you live a better life.</p><p><br></p><p>Paraphrasing <a href="https://amzn.to/3JEvvdc" target="_blank">Dr. David Yonggi Cho, in his book "The 4th Dimension"</a>, fear is faith in the negative. When you have fear, you believe (you have faith) that something bad will happen.</p><p><br></p><p>To regain control of your life, start by making small changes in your daily routine, and then work your way up to more significant changes. Be patient with yourself, and be accepting of the fact that change doesn't happen overnight. But eventually, if you keep working at it, you will get to where you want to be.</p><p><br></p><p>So, these are just a few tips on how to regain control of your life and live the life you want.</p><p><br></p><p>Hopefully, this article has given you some new ideas on how to regain control over your life.</p><p><br></p><p>The most important thing is to stay positive and have faith in yourself. You can do it!</p><p>But remember, each person's journey is unique, so find what works best for you and stick with it.</p><p><br></p><p><img src="https://assets.grooveapps.com/images/5eac10cdb05c940cb33afb8a/1647796789_Live in the present moment.webp"></p>
