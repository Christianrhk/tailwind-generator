				Decentralized finance, or DeFi, sits at the white-hot center of the recent crypto bull run.. DeFi is crypto's big thing at the moment, a little like how Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) were all the rage back in 2017. Back in June 2020, just $1 billion was locked up in DeFi protocols, according to metrics site DeFi Pulse.By January 2020, "DeFi degens" had poured over $20 billion worth of ...			</p>

				DeFi is a concept of automated financial processes. Basically, it allows you to directly do things that require bank support without the banks. You can borrow, lend, buy insurance, trade, and enter into different contracts and execute those contracts automatically. It is faster because it does not require the paperwork of a third party.			</p>

						<p>
				Just when you think you've figured out blockchain and cryptocurrencies and NFTs, along comes DeFi (that's short for 'decentralized finance'). Staying ahead of the game is critical for finance professionals as these technologies continue to disrupt longstanding financial institutions and processes.

						<p>
				Decentralized finance, or even 'DeFi', is the rising digital economical system that in theory gets rid of the advantages of some sort of middle bank or perhaps authorities agency in order to say yes to financial dealings.			</p>

						<p>
				In simple terms, DeFi or Decentralised Finance can be defined as a merger of traditional banking services with blockchain technology. It replaces some components of the traditional financial system with smart contracts on a blockchain. Thus, DeFi offers financial services carried out on a blockchain (the most common blockchain used is Ethereum).			</p>

						<p>
				A Beginner's Guide to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) By Sid Coelho-Prabhu Cryptocurrency's promise is to make money and payments universally accessible- to anyone, no matter where they are in the world. The Decentralized Finance (DeFi) or Open Finance movement takes that promise a step further.			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralized finance, also referred to as "DeFi" or open finance, aims to recreate traditional financial systems (such as lending, borrowing, derivatives, and exchange) with automation in place of middlemen. Once fully automated, the financial building blocks of DeFi can be composed to produce more complex capabilities.			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralised Finance, also known as DeFi for short, is a new form of finance that doesn't rely on centralised banks, allowing users to trade, invest, borrow, earn interest and more. Based on blockchain technology and smart contracts, DeFi crypto allows users to manage their own finances in a completely trustless system.			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols have come a long way from a few scattered vaguely known projects to multi-billion giants. These include a diverse group of protocols providing a single core functionality, experimental projects and those combining multiple core functionalities to create complex powerful platforms.			</p>

						<p>
				üè¶ Decentralized Finance Open & borderless financial system that connects the world through the internet. Peer to Peer instead of relying on banks or institutions. Financial service 'apps' that run themselves and are governed by its users via voting. (example: Compound) ‚õìÔ∏è Blockchain Public, digital database of crypto currency transactions.			</p>
