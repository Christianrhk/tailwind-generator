      Focal Point Tree Care is not your typical &ldquo;tree care service&rdquo;.  Most tree companies focus on the removal aspect of tree care. We choose to focus on the CARE of trees. Part of that care is pruning which promotes tree health, strong branching structure and enhance overall shape.
      <br><br>
      Trees are living art and through pruning we bring that art form into focus.
      <br><br>
      Most trees in landscape environments require pruning in order to keep them healthy:
      <br><br>
            Branch weight reduction- Many trees and shrubs if not pruned can grow so fast that the branches tend to hang low from all the weight, sometimes all the way to the ground. Add the weight of rain, wind and snow and the branches can break causing tears in the trunk. We look for cuts to lift branches and reduce mass towards the end of limbs.
                  <br><br>
          Thinning &ndash; This is the technique that can really bring out the art of your tress and shrubs. Not only does thinning help to get light and air into the canopy it also allows you to see the trunk shape.
          Deadwood &ndash; Trees can over produce branching in the Spring that can die back over time due to shading. Deadwood can also be a result of  injury or pest damage. This deadwood can be removed to create more space for sunlight and air to penetrate to the inner canopy. promoting a healthier tree.

      I began my interest in tree care at UC Santa Cruz where I studied Environmental Studies. My graduation thesis was to determine the stress levels and overall health of the two varieties of oak trees native to campus.
      <br><br>
      I furthered my knowledge as an apprentice arborist working for large estates in Silicon Valley for 9 years. These estates were rife with exotic trees, shrub and plant species. My training was unique in that our clients hired us to work on their properties knowing that we brought to every job an extremely high level of skill, knowledge and attention to detail that was not commonly found in other tree care companies.
      <br><br>
      I left The Bay Area in 2008 looking for a better quality of life,  a community that fit my lifestyle and interests and a place to start my own tree care business founded on the same high standards in which I was trained.
      <br><br>
      I officially opened, Focal Point Tree Care in 2011. In the Central Oregon area, where word of mouth is the best advertising, the business has expanded exponentially every year. This success has been due largely to our customer service, attention to detail, and exceeding expectations on every job.
      <br><br>
      As the business continues to grow it is my promise that quality and customer service will always be the of the highest priority. In other words, I will be present on every job.
      <br><br>
      I look forward to meeting with you and discussing your tree care visions and concerns,
      <br><br>
