				Put simply, bitcoin is intended to be the most secure, sovereign option for savings that the world has ever seen, while DeFi is so far into the realm of "investment" that it can more properly be referred to as outright gambling.			</p>

						<p>
				It's always possible that it becomes more overbought and goes up to something like $300 before that happens, but that's only a 20% upside, whereas a drop to, say, $120, would be a 50% downside. This is probably the quintessential example of a bad trade.			</p>

				DeFi is an emerging technology in finance with little or no regulatory supervision. The following DeFi projects have had a great year in 2021. Â· Terra (LUNA) From US$0.6 on January 1 to US$48 as of now, LUNA was one of the best performing altcoins of 2021. What adds to the appeal is very high market cap of nearly US$23 billion.			</p>

				The difference is that lateral tokens will be tokenized real-world assets. The portfolio of these assets starts relatively simple and will diversify more and more over time as more and more assets are being tokenized.
