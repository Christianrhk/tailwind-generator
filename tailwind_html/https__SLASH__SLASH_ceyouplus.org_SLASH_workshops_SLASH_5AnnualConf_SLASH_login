Class A
ReImagining Mandated Reporting (3 CE Credits)
The United States has historically relied heavily on mandated reporting, believing it is a causal factor in child abuse prevention. However, to date, there has not been any published research suggestive of such causation. In fact, our reliance on mandated reporting as the primary response to help families arguably introduces more opportunity for systemic racism, implicit biases, and the unwarranted removal of children from their homes.
This presentation reviews the legal and social history of mandated reporting laws and family separation, examines the ethical conundrum of mandated reporting as it relates to evidence-based practice, and discusses alternatives to mandated reporting as a primary prevention strategy.
The presentation includes an examination of &amp;ldquo;reasonable belief&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;suspicion&amp;rdquo; requirement in mandated reporting laws and guidance on how to respond to a child disclosure of maltreatment, and what to do when a professional observes maltreatment &amp;ldquo;warning signs&amp;rdquo;. We will also focus on alternative responses, highlighting how and when to implement them without violating mandated reporting laws. Overall, this presentation challenges participants to think of consequence beyond just the reporting call, and to be creative in implementing family support systems.
This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.
(Trainers: Katie Olson, J.D, is the Training Director in the Institute to Transform Child Protection at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St Paul, Minnesota. Katie has gained multiple child welfare perspectives working as victim liaison, maltreatment investigator, child&#039;s attorney, and training director. Her work focuses on promoting safe and strong families through trauma responsive legal advocacy and inter-disciplinary collaboration.
Miriam Itzkowitz, MSW, LISW, is the Director of Trauma-Informed Care for the Institute for Children, Families and Communities at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St Paul, Minnesota. Miriam develops and provides training on best practices at the intersection of legal services and trauma-informed care. She also serves as the social work supervisor for graduate social work students to link theory and practice and to serve the clients represented through ITCP.)
Class B
The Road to Reconciliation: A Comprehensive Guide to Helping Your Clients Find Peace When Their Relationships Go Bad (3 CE Credits)
Every client you will see is likely to have hurt or been hurt by their loved ones. This is understandably true of most of those who come to see you for marriage counseling and trauma, but it&amp;rsquo;s also the case when the presenting problem is addiction or another mental health condition. The focus of treatment may not be on the harm caused or suffered, but relationships need to be mended before recovery can be solid.
This workshop describes a process of healing and potential forgiveness for anyone in a relationship affected by selfishness, violence, abuse, addiction, or betrayal; whether they are the victim, the perpetrator, or both. It guides participants on how to assess the damage done and recognize codependency and vindictiveness, blocking the way from injury to peace. It gives pragmatic advice on how to help clients find safety, assert needs, apologize, make amends, and promote change.&amp;nbsp;
This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.

Class B
What Communication Language Do You Speak? A Blueprint for Conscious Communication in a Virtual World for Mental Health Professionals (4 CE credits)
Living in the pandemic has exposed lots of relationship challenges on a personal and professional level, poor communication being one of them. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in exponential growth in teletherapy services. This paradigm shift did not require training in delivering telehealth services and came without uniform standards of practice. However, it is acknowledged that mental health professionals providing telehealth services need advanced communication skills.
This communication&amp;rsquo;s skill building training will introduce clinicians to the Kendall&amp;rsquo;s Life Languages System of Communication, also known as the 7 Life Languages&amp;trade; Profile (Kendall &amp;amp; Kendall, 2019). This communication tool captures how people communicate based on how they act, think, and feel. Clinicians will learn the concept of conscious communication, which will help them to listen with empathy, speak responsibly, build relationship equity with their clients, and help clients effectively manage conflict.

Cannabis and Mental Health (3 CE Credits)
This presentation will help participants understand how cannabis affects mental health and why people with mental health difficulties use this drug. We will explore options for supporting cannabis users in social service settings. Cannabis is more available across North America than ever before and there are many misconceptions about the effects of this drug on mental health. Participants will receive an overview of the research examining the relation between cannabis and stress, trauma, common health difficulties, and a variety of mental health concerns.
This overview will lead into material on clinical assessment, education, treatment, and harm reduction strategies with cannabis consumers. Material will cover topics including the effects of cannabis use on stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, pain, anger, psychosis, and more. There will be implications for engagement, education, applying evidence-informed therapies for cannabis use disorder, and relapse prevention.
(Trainer, Amar Ghelani is a registered social worker, PhD Candidate, and instructor with the Wilfrid Laurier Faculty of Social Work in Toronto, Ontario. He has over 15 years of social work practice experience in addiction rehabilitation, shelters, prisons, schools, outpatient mental health, and healthcare settings.

Class B
&amp;nbsp;See My Color - Why Racial Colorblindness is Unethical
More than 50 years after Dr. King&#039;s speech, racial disparities continue to exist in various systems, including healthcare, education, the criminal justice system and those impacted by poverty. As a counselor, not only is it unrealistic to be racially colorblind, it is dangerous and does more harm than good. If you don&#039;t see my color, you can&#039;t see me. And if you can&#039;t see me how can you empathize with my racial experiences, accept my whole being and validate my perspectives.
(Trainer, Crystal Bennett is an educator, an advocate, a survivor and a self-proclaimed thriver! For the past 25 years she has been driven by her personal experiences of trauma to elevate and amplify the voices of individuals and communities in order to promote healing and opportunities to move from surviving to thriving.)
Class C
Human Trafficking of People with Disabilities (3 CE credits)
The world&#039;s largest minority group is people with disabilities, and this populations experiences crime, including human trafficking, at far higher rates than their counterparts without disabilities. Yet people with disabilities are often left out of programming, education, and services. Many service professionals also report not feeling comfortable or equipped to work with people with disabilities, despite the reality that they will likely interact with people with disabilities regularly. This presentation provides an overview of disabilities , an introduction to human trafficking, and guidance on how to interact and service human trafficking victims who have disabilities.&lt;br /&gt;
(Trainer, Laura Cusack, MSW is a Senior Victim Advocate and subject matter expert on human trafficking. Laura&amp;rsquo;s experience includes providing training to service providers on specific needs of crime victims with disabilities according to the Rehab Act, ADA, and fair housing act, as well as providing training on human trafficking and crimes against children.

Using Metaphors and Storytelling to teach DBT Skill (3 CE Credits)
In her seminal work introducing Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Marsha Linehan points to the need to teach DBT through metaphors and stories. Comparing something that is abstract, complex, and difficult to something concrete and tangible allows people to go beyond simple cognition, to understanding the more complex realities of life. DBT skills training has received empirical support to be used in the treatment of many different conditions. It has also been shown to enhance social and global functioning.
This training will examine the rationale for using metaphors and storytelling to teach DBT skills, plus practical tips for doing so effectively. Metaphors and storytelling will be used to provide an overview of the four DBT modules (Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness) as well as the DBT concept of Radical Acceptance.
(Trainer, James J Esmail, PsyD is a licensed clinical psychologist who has been in practice for 26 years. Dr. Esmail is a staff psychologist at the state psychiatric hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio and is in private practice, providing DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) skill training in both sites.

The Your Money, Your Goals toolkit, created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is comprehensive and brings together information, tools, and links to other resources case managers and social workers can use to help clients build skills in managing money, credit, debt, and financial products. Having all these resources in one place can make it easier for you to bring financial empowerment concepts into conversations you may already be having. This can help the people you work with increase the financial stability in their lives.
Although, sharing this information and tools may feel like a completely different job from your current one, another thing you&amp;rsquo;re being asked to add to your workload, once you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the resources in this toolkit, it can become natural to integrate its contents into the work you do every day.

The Help: Preserving Ethics and Integrity in the Face of Moral Injury and Adversity
What we do starts with who we are. Deciding who we are begins with deciding who we really want to be. Recently the President of the United States asked citizens, &amp;ldquo;What kind of nation are we going to be?&amp;rdquo; Political affiliations aside, as social workers and the leaders of moral resilience and courage, this is a call to action directly to us to help our society make the decision to be a nation that puts humanity first. In this training we ask social workers to engage in self inventory to answer one question; what kind of helper will I be?

Using Metaphors and Storytelling to teach DBT Skill (3 CE Credits)
In her seminal work introducing Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Marsha Linehan points to the need to teach DBT through metaphors and stories. Comparing something that is abstract, complex, and difficult to something concrete and tangible allows people to go beyond simple cognition, to understanding the more complex realities of life. DBT skills training has received empirical support to be used in the treatment of many different conditions. It has also been shown to enhance social and global functioning.
This training will examine the rationale for using metaphors and storytelling to teach DBT skills, plus practical tips for doing so effectively. Metaphors and storytelling will be used to provide an overview of the four DBT modules (Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness) as well as the DBT concept of Radical Acceptance.
(Trainer, James J Esmail, PsyD is a licensed clinical psychologist who has been in practice for 26 years. Dr. Esmail is a staff psychologist at the state psychiatric hospital in Cincinnati, Ohio and is in private practice, providing DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) skill training in both sites. Dr. Esmail is the author of DBT Metaphors and Stories: Understanding the Skills that Make Life Worth Living (2020, Routledge). Dr. Esmail is also an adjunct professor in the graduate school of psychology, Xavier University.)

Your Money Your Goals: An Empowerment Toolkit (3 CE Credits)
The Your Money, Your Goals toolkit, created by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is comprehensive and brings together information, tools, and links to other resources case managers and social workers can use to help clients build skills in managing money, credit, debt, and financial products. Having all these resources in one place can make it easier for you to bring financial empowerment concepts into conversations you may already be having. This can help the people you work with increase the financial stability in their lives.
Although, sharing this information and tools may feel like a completely different job from your current one, another thing you&amp;rsquo;re being asked to add to your workload, once you&amp;rsquo;re familiar with the resources in this toolkit, it can become natural to integrate its contents into the work you do every day.
(Trainer, Vanessa Bright, MBA, AFC (Accredited Financial Counselor), is the Founder and Executive Director of The Maryland Reentry Resource Center.

&amp;nbsp;Signaling&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;safety for LGBTQ clients: Ethics, Suicide Prevention and cultural competency (4 CE Credits)
LGBTQ individuals are at an elevated risk of experiencing suicidality and suicide, and there is a need for treatment modalities that can address the unique needs of this community when providing treatment. We know that culturally competent care is one of the most important protective factors for members of the LGBTQ community.
This course will help attendees gain competency and awareness of the community and unique elements for providing care. It will provide updated information on recent research regarding the issues and evidence based care, as well as how standard practices can be modified to meet the unique needs of this population. It will also provide necessary ethical information about confidentiality and mandated reporting when working with Suicidality and the LGBTQ community.

Navigating the Nervous System - Incorporating Nervous System Know How into Play Therapy (4 CE Credits) 
Ever wonder what&amp;rsquo;s happening inside of you and your clients as you play? Come explore the primary role your nervous system takes in the play therapy room. Drawing from current research in interpersonal neurobiology, relational neurosciences, and more, this introduction to the nervous system will help you learn how to work with your own nervous system to provide a better regulated and connected presence for your clients. By doing this, you can learn to track, monitor, and work with the underlying physiology driving your behaviors and the behaviors you see in the playroom. In turn, your clients and their caregivers can settle into a felt-sense of safety, allowing them to move towards a deeper level of healing and growth.

The Help: Preserving Ethics and Integrity in the Face of Moral Injury and Adversity
What we do starts with who we are. Deciding who we are begins with deciding who we really want to be. Recently the President of the United States asked citizens, &amp;ldquo;What kind of nation are we going to be?&amp;rdquo; Political affiliations aside, as social workers and the leaders of moral resilience and courage, this is a call to action directly to us to help our society make the decision to be a nation that puts humanity first. In this training we ask social workers to engage in self inventory to answer one question; what kind of helper will I be?
(Trainer, Keisha Atlee, LCSW-C, has served as a child welfare professional for 18 years specializing with adolescents and young adults. Keisha has served as a leader across the private and public Child Welfare Sector, Highlighting her role as a Field Liaison with Morgan State University as a pinnacle in her journey to build better social work practitioners.)

Overcoming Academic Anxiety Disorders (3 CE credits)
When children, adolescents, and/or adults learners are poor readers, test-takers, and struggle with math, it reflects on their academic and occupational achievement and raises red flags for teachers and employers. As such these difficulties can inhibit an individual&#039;s lifelong goals. This workshop concerns these problems; Academic Anxiety Disorders, which involve Test, Math, and Reading Anxiety. What are the nature of Academic Anxiety Disorders? How do you identify/spot Academic Anxiety Disorders? How can you alleviate/remediate them? This new training with John Zbornik, PhD will take a fresh look at what clinicians can do to help clients navigate through and around their Academic Anxiety Disorders.
(Trainer: John Zbornik Ph.D. is a Psychologist/School Psychologist with over 30 years of practice. John is in private practice specializing in the assessment of Learning Disabilities, Autism Attention Problems, Anxiety, Depression, and Academic Anxiety Disorders. John&#039;s research interests have concentrated upon Academic Anxiety Disorders, particularly Reading Anxiety.)

However, to date, there has not been any published research suggestive of such causation. In fact, our reliance on mandated reporting as the primary response to help families arguably introduces more opportunity for systemic racism, implicit biases, and the unwarranted removal of children from their homes.<\/span>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;\">This presentation reviews the legal and social history of mandated reporting laws and family separation, examines the ethical conundrum of mandated reporting as it relates to evidence-based practice, and discusses alternatives to mandated reporting as a primary prevention strategy.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;\">The presentation includes an examination of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; requirement in mandated reporting laws and guidance on how to respond to a child disclosure of maltreatment, and what to do when a professional observes maltreatment &ldquo;warning signs&rdquo;. We will also focus on alternative responses, highlighting how and when to implement them without violating mandated reporting laws. Overall, this presentation challenges participants to think of consequence beyond just the reporting call, and to be creative in implementing family support systems.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;\">This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.<\/span><\/p>\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;\">(Trainers: Katie Olson, J.D, is the Training Director in the Institute to Transform Child Protection at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St Paul, Minnesota.

<p id="ReImagining"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>ReImagining Mandated Reporting (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The United States has historically relied heavily on mandated reporting, believing it is a causal factor in child abuse prevention. However, to date, there has not been any published research suggestive of such causation. In fact, our reliance on mandated reporting as the primary response to help families arguably introduces more opportunity for systemic racism, implicit biases, and the unwarranted removal of children from their homes.</span>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation reviews the legal and social history of mandated reporting laws and family separation, examines the ethical conundrum of mandated reporting as it relates to evidence-based practice, and discusses alternatives to mandated reporting as a primary prevention strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The presentation includes an examination of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; requirement in mandated reporting laws and guidance on how to respond to a child disclosure of maltreatment, and what to do when a professional observes maltreatment &ldquo;warning signs&rdquo;. We will also focus on alternative responses, highlighting how and when to implement them without violating mandated reporting laws. Overall, this presentation challenges participants to think of consequence beyond just the reporting call, and to be creative in implementing family support systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainers: Katie Olson, J.D, is the Training Director in the Institute to Transform Child Protection at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St Paul, Minnesota.

<p id="TheRoad"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Road to Reconciliation: A Comprehensive Guide to Helping Your Clients Find Peace When Their Relationships Go Bad (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Every client you will see is likely to have hurt or been hurt by their loved ones. This is understandably true of most of those who come to see you for marriage counseling and trauma, but it&rsquo;s also the case when the presenting problem is addiction or another mental health condition. The focus of treatment may not be on the harm caused or suffered, but relationships need to be mended before recovery can be solid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This workshop describes a process of healing and potential forgiveness for anyone in a relationship affected by selfishness, violence, abuse, addiction, or betrayal; whether they are the victim, the perpetrator, or both. It guides participants on how to assess the damage done and recognize codependency and vindictiveness, blocking the way from injury to peace. It gives pragmatic advice on how to help clients find safety, assert needs, apologize, make amends, and promote change.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p id="TheFuture"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The future of diagnostics in treating mental health issues (4 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">How is the world of Mental Health diagnostics changing? This new training will cover a variety of topics that have to do with diagnosing and treating mental health conditions, and a look at multiple diagnostic systems. Epigenetics will be discussed, including their impact on Adverse Childhood Experiences and Developmental Trauma. There will be a discussion of the neurobiological and neuropsychological basis of depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainer: Dr. Donna Veraldi, PhD is retired from over 40 years practice as a psychologist.

<p id="What"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What Communication Language Do You Speak? A Blueprint for Conscious Communication in a Virtual World for Mental Health Professionals (4 CE credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Living in the pandemic has exposed lots of relationship challenges on a personal and professional level, poor communication being one of them. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in exponential growth in teletherapy services. This paradigm shift did not require training in delivering telehealth services and came without uniform standards of practice. However, it is acknowledged that mental health professionals providing telehealth services need advanced communication skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This communication&rsquo;s skill building training will introduce clinicians to the Kendall&rsquo;s Life Languages System of Communication, also known as the 7 Life Languages&trade; Profile (Kendall &amp; Kendall, 2019). This communication tool captures how people communicate based on how they act, think, and feel. Clinicians will learn the concept of conscious communication, which will help them to listen with empathy, speak responsibly, build relationship equity with their clients, and help clients effectively manage conflict.</span></p>

<p id="Cannabis"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Cannabis and Mental Health (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation will help participants understand how cannabis affects mental health and why people with mental health difficulties use this drug. We will explore options for supporting cannabis users in social service settings. Cannabis is more available across North America than ever before and there are many misconceptions about the effects of this drug on mental health. Participants will receive an overview of the research examining the relation between cannabis and stress, trauma, common health difficulties, and a variety of mental health concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This overview will lead into material on clinical assessment, education, treatment, and harm reduction strategies with cannabis consumers. Material will cover topics including the effects of cannabis use on stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, pain, anger, psychosis, and more. There will be implications for engagement, education, applying evidence-informed therapies for cannabis use disorder, and relapse prevention.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">More than 50 years after Dr. King's speech, racial disparities continue to exist in various systems, including healthcare, education, the criminal justice system and those impacted by poverty. As a counselor, not only is it unrealistic to be racially colorblind, it is dangerous and does more harm than good. If you don't see my color, you can't see me. And if you can't see me how can you empathize with my racial experiences, accept my whole being and validate my perspectives.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainer, Crystal Bennett is an educator, an advocate, a survivor and a self-proclaimed thriver! For the past 25 years she has been driven by her personal experiences of trauma to elevate and amplify the voices of individuals and communities in order to promote healing and opportunities to move from surviving to thriving.)</span></p>

<p id="Overcoming"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Human Trafficking of People with Disabilities (3 CE credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The world's largest minority group is people with disabilities, and this populations experiences crime, including human trafficking, at far higher rates than their counterparts without disabilities. Yet people with disabilities are often left out of programming, education, and services. Many service professionals also report not feeling comfortable or equipped to work with people with disabilities, despite the reality that they will likely interact with people with disabilities regularly. This presentation provides an overview of disabilities , an introduction to human trafficking, and guidance on how to interact and service human trafficking victims who have disabilities.<br /></span></p>

<p id="UsingMetaphors"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Using Metaphors and Storytelling to teach DBT Skill (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">In her seminal work introducing Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Marsha Linehan points to the need to teach DBT through metaphors and stories. Comparing something that is abstract, complex, and difficult to something concrete and tangible allows people to go beyond simple cognition, to understanding the more complex realities of life. DBT skills training has received empirical support to be used in the treatment of many different conditions. It has also been shown to enhance social and global functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This training will examine the rationale for using metaphors and storytelling to teach DBT skills, plus practical tips for doing so effectively. Metaphors and storytelling will be used to provide an overview of the four DBT modules (Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness) as well as the DBT concept of Radical Acceptance.</span></p>

Having all these resources in one place can make it easier for you to bring financial empowerment concepts into conversations you may already be having. This can help the people you work with increase the financial stability in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Although, sharing this information and tools may feel like a completely different job from your current one, another thing you&rsquo;re being asked to add to your workload, once you&rsquo;re familiar with the resources in this toolkit, it can become natural to integrate its contents into the work you do every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">LGBTQ individuals are at an elevated risk of experiencing suicidality and suicide, and there is a need for treatment modalities that can address the unique needs of this community when providing treatment. We know that culturally competent care is one of the most important protective factors for members of the LGBTQ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This course will help attendees gain competency and awareness of the community and unique elements for providing care. It will provide updated information on recent research regarding the issues and evidence based care, as well as how standard practices can be modified to meet the unique needs of this population. It will also provide necessary ethical information about confidentiality and mandated reporting when working with Suicidality and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Ever wonder what&rsquo;s happening inside of you and your clients as you play? Come explore the primary role your nervous system takes in the play therapy room. Drawing from current research in interpersonal neurobiology, relational neurosciences, and more, this introduction to the nervous system will help you learn how to work with your own nervous system to provide a better regulated and connected presence for your clients. By doing this, you can learn to track, monitor, and work with the underlying physiology driving your behaviors and the behaviors you see in the playroom. In turn, your clients and their caregivers can settle into a felt-sense of safety, allowing them to move towards a deeper level of healing and growth.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">What we do starts with who we are. Deciding who we are begins with deciding who we really want to be. Recently the President of the United States asked citizens, &ldquo;What kind of nation are we going to be?&rdquo; Political affiliations aside, as social workers and the leaders of moral resilience and courage, this is a call to action directly to us to help our society make the decision to be a nation that puts humanity first. In this training we ask social workers to engage in self inventory to answer one question; what kind of helper will I be?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">When children, adolescents, and/or adults learners are poor readers, test-takers, and struggle with math, it reflects on their academic and occupational achievement and raises red flags for teachers and employers. As such these difficulties can inhibit an individual's lifelong goals. This workshop concerns these problems; Academic Anxiety Disorders, which involve Test, Math, and Reading Anxiety. What are the nature of Academic Anxiety Disorders? How do you identify/spot Academic Anxiety Disorders? How can you alleviate/remediate them?

<p id="ReImagining"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>ReImagining Mandated Reporting (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The United States has historically relied heavily on mandated reporting, believing it is a causal factor in child abuse prevention. However, to date, there has not been any published research suggestive of such causation. In fact, our reliance on mandated reporting as the primary response to help families arguably introduces more opportunity for systemic racism, implicit biases, and the unwarranted removal of children from their homes.</span>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation reviews the legal and social history of mandated reporting laws and family separation, examines the ethical conundrum of mandated reporting as it relates to evidence-based practice, and discusses alternatives to mandated reporting as a primary prevention strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The presentation includes an examination of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; requirement in mandated reporting laws and guidance on how to respond to a child disclosure of maltreatment, and what to do when a professional observes maltreatment &ldquo;warning signs&rdquo;. We will also focus on alternative responses, highlighting how and when to implement them without violating mandated reporting laws. Overall, this presentation challenges participants to think of consequence beyond just the reporting call, and to be creative in implementing family support systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainers: Katie Olson, J.D, is the Training Director in the Institute to Transform Child Protection at the Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St Paul, Minnesota. Katie has gained multiple child welfare perspectives working as victim liaison, maltreatment investigator, child's attorney, and training director. Her work focuses on promoting safe and strong families through trauma responsive legal advocacy and inter-disciplinary collaboration.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Miriam Itzkowitz, MSW, LISW, is the Director of Trauma-Informed Care for the Institute for Children, Families and Communities at Mitchell Hamline School of Law in St Paul, Minnesota. Miriam develops and provides training on best practices at the intersection of legal services and trauma-informed care. She also serves as the social work supervisor for graduate social work students to link theory and practice and to serve the clients represented through ITCP.)</span></p>

<p id="TheRoad"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Road to Reconciliation: A Comprehensive Guide to Helping Your Clients Find Peace When Their Relationships Go Bad (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Every client you will see is likely to have hurt or been hurt by their loved ones. This is understandably true of most of those who come to see you for marriage counseling and trauma, but it&rsquo;s also the case when the presenting problem is addiction or another mental health condition. The focus of treatment may not be on the harm caused or suffered, but relationships need to be mended before recovery can be solid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This workshop describes a process of healing and potential forgiveness for anyone in a relationship affected by selfishness, violence, abuse, addiction, or betrayal; whether they are the victim, the perpetrator, or both. It guides participants on how to assess the damage done and recognize codependency and vindictiveness, blocking the way from injury to peace. It gives pragmatic advice on how to help clients find safety, assert needs, apologize, make amends, and promote change.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p id="TheFuture"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The future of diagnostics in treating mental health issues (4 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">How is the world of Mental Health diagnostics changing? This new training will cover a variety of topics that have to do with diagnosing and treating mental health conditions, and a look at multiple diagnostic systems. Epigenetics will be discussed, including their impact on Adverse Childhood Experiences and Developmental Trauma. There will be a discussion of the neurobiological and neuropsychological basis of depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainer: Dr. Donna Veraldi, PhD is retired from over 40 years practice as a psychologist. Most of Dr. Veraldi's work involved a private practice of clinical and forensic work in Billings Montana. Dr. Veraldi has presented numerous papers and publications, is a past president of the Yellowstone Psychological Association, has taught at the college level, and has been a frequent presenter for the American College of Forensic Psychology.)</span></p>

<p id="What"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>What Communication Language Do You Speak? A Blueprint for Conscious Communication in a Virtual World for Mental Health Professionals (4 CE credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Living in the pandemic has exposed lots of relationship challenges on a personal and professional level, poor communication being one of them. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in exponential growth in teletherapy services. This paradigm shift did not require training in delivering telehealth services and came without uniform standards of practice. However, it is acknowledged that mental health professionals providing telehealth services need advanced communication skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This communication&rsquo;s skill building training will introduce clinicians to the Kendall&rsquo;s Life Languages System of Communication, also known as the 7 Life Languages&trade; Profile (Kendall &amp; Kendall, 2019). This communication tool captures how people communicate based on how they act, think, and feel. Clinicians will learn the concept of conscious communication, which will help them to listen with empathy, speak responsibly, build relationship equity with their clients, and help clients effectively manage conflict.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainer, Veronica Powell, PhD, LPC. has practiced as a Behavioral Health Clinician and trainer for more than 25 years, Dr. Powell's mission is to transform the lives of her clients so that they will experience sustained holistic emotional, mental and behavioral health growth. She describes herself as an "Educator of Life" with expertise in the areas of trauma informed care, substance abuse, communication and emotional intelligence.)</span></p>

<p id="Cannabis"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Cannabis and Mental Health (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation will help participants understand how cannabis affects mental health and why people with mental health difficulties use this drug. We will explore options for supporting cannabis users in social service settings. Cannabis is more available across North America than ever before and there are many misconceptions about the effects of this drug on mental health. Participants will receive an overview of the research examining the relation between cannabis and stress, trauma, common health difficulties, and a variety of mental health concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This overview will lead into material on clinical assessment, education, treatment, and harm reduction strategies with cannabis consumers. Material will cover topics including the effects of cannabis use on stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, pain, anger, psychosis, and more. There will be implications for engagement, education, applying evidence-informed therapies for cannabis use disorder, and relapse prevention.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainer, Amar Ghelani is a registered social worker, PhD Candidate, and instructor with the Wilfrid Laurier Faculty of Social Work in Toronto, Ontario. He has over 15 years of social work practice experience in addiction rehabilitation, shelters, prisons, schools, outpatient mental health, and healthcare settings. His research focuses on the relation between cannabis, psychosis, and social relationships.)</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">More than 50 years after Dr. King's speech, racial disparities continue to exist in various systems, including healthcare, education, the criminal justice system and those impacted by poverty. As a counselor, not only is it unrealistic to be racially colorblind, it is dangerous and does more harm than good. If you don't see my color, you can't see me. And if you can't see me how can you empathize with my racial experiences, accept my whole being and validate my perspectives.</span></p>

<p id="Overcoming"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>Human Trafficking of People with Disabilities (3 CE credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The world's largest minority group is people with disabilities, and this populations experiences crime, including human trafficking, at far higher rates than their counterparts without disabilities. Yet people with disabilities are often left out of programming, education, and services. Many service professionals also report not feeling comfortable or equipped to work with people with disabilities, despite the reality that they will likely interact with people with disabilities regularly. This presentation provides an overview of disabilities , an introduction to human trafficking, and guidance on how to interact and service human trafficking victims who have disabilities.<br /></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">In her seminal work introducing Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Marsha Linehan points to the need to teach DBT through metaphors and stories. Comparing something that is abstract, complex, and difficult to something concrete and tangible allows people to go beyond simple cognition, to understanding the more complex realities of life. DBT skills training has received empirical support to be used in the treatment of many different conditions. It has also been shown to enhance social and global functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This training will examine the rationale for using metaphors and storytelling to teach DBT skills, plus practical tips for doing so effectively. Metaphors and storytelling will be used to provide an overview of the four DBT modules (Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness) as well as the DBT concept of Radical Acceptance.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">(Trainer, James J Esmail, PsyD is a licensed clinical psychologist who has been in practice for 26 years.

Having all these resources in one place can make it easier for you to bring financial empowerment concepts into conversations you may already be having. This can help the people you work with increase the financial stability in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Although, sharing this information and tools may feel like a completely different job from your current one, another thing you&rsquo;re being asked to add to your workload, once you&rsquo;re familiar with the resources in this toolkit, it can become natural to integrate its contents into the work you do every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">LGBTQ individuals are at an elevated risk of experiencing suicidality and suicide, and there is a need for treatment modalities that can address the unique needs of this community when providing treatment. We know that culturally competent care is one of the most important protective factors for members of the LGBTQ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This course will help attendees gain competency and awareness of the community and unique elements for providing care. It will provide updated information on recent research regarding the issues and evidence based care, as well as how standard practices can be modified to meet the unique needs of this population. It will also provide necessary ethical information about confidentiality and mandated reporting when working with Suicidality and the LGBTQ community.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Ever wonder what&rsquo;s happening inside of you and your clients as you play? Come explore the primary role your nervous system takes in the play therapy room. Drawing from current research in interpersonal neurobiology, relational neurosciences, and more, this introduction to the nervous system will help you learn how to work with your own nervous system to provide a better regulated and connected presence for your clients. By doing this, you can learn to track, monitor, and work with the underlying physiology driving your behaviors and the behaviors you see in the playroom. In turn, your clients and their caregivers can settle into a felt-sense of safety, allowing them to move towards a deeper level of healing and growth.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">What we do starts with who we are. Deciding who we are begins with deciding who we really want to be. Recently the President of the United States asked citizens, &ldquo;What kind of nation are we going to be?&rdquo; Political affiliations aside, as social workers and the leaders of moral resilience and courage, this is a call to action directly to us to help our society make the decision to be a nation that puts humanity first. In this training we ask social workers to engage in self inventory to answer one question; what kind of helper will I be?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">When children, adolescents, and/or adults learners are poor readers, test-takers, and struggle with math, it reflects on their academic and occupational achievement and raises red flags for teachers and employers. As such these difficulties can inhibit an individual's lifelong goals. This workshop concerns these problems; Academic Anxiety Disorders, which involve Test, Math, and Reading Anxiety. What are the nature of Academic Anxiety Disorders? How do you identify/spot Academic Anxiety Disorders? How can you alleviate/remediate them? This new training with John Zbornik, PhD will take a fresh look at what clinicians can do to help clients navigate through and around their Academic Anxiety Disorders.</span></p>

<p id="ReImagining"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>ReImagining Mandated Reporting (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<div><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The United States has historically relied heavily on mandated reporting, believing it is a causal factor in child abuse prevention. However, to date, there has not been any published research suggestive of such causation. In fact, our reliance on mandated reporting as the primary response to help families arguably introduces more opportunity for systemic racism, implicit biases, and the unwarranted removal of children from their homes.</span>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation reviews the legal and social history of mandated reporting laws and family separation, examines the ethical conundrum of mandated reporting as it relates to evidence-based practice, and discusses alternatives to mandated reporting as a primary prevention strategy.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The presentation includes an examination of &ldquo;reasonable belief&rdquo; or &ldquo;suspicion&rdquo; requirement in mandated reporting laws and guidance on how to respond to a child disclosure of maltreatment, and what to do when a professional observes maltreatment &ldquo;warning signs&rdquo;. We will also focus on alternative responses, highlighting how and when to implement them without violating mandated reporting laws. Overall, this presentation challenges participants to think of consequence beyond just the reporting call, and to be creative in implementing family support systems.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.</span></p>

<p id="TheRoad"><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;"><strong>The Road to Reconciliation: A Comprehensive Guide to Helping Your Clients Find Peace When Their Relationships Go Bad (3 CE Credits)</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Every client you will see is likely to have hurt or been hurt by their loved ones. This is understandably true of most of those who come to see you for marriage counseling and trauma, but it&rsquo;s also the case when the presenting problem is addiction or another mental health condition. The focus of treatment may not be on the harm caused or suffered, but relationships need to be mended before recovery can be solid.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This workshop describes a process of healing and potential forgiveness for anyone in a relationship affected by selfishness, violence, abuse, addiction, or betrayal; whether they are the victim, the perpetrator, or both. It guides participants on how to assess the damage done and recognize codependency and vindictiveness, blocking the way from injury to peace. It gives pragmatic advice on how to help clients find safety, assert needs, apologize, make amends, and promote change.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation recognizes and acknowledges that there are many cases where reporting is important and required to ensure child safety. We will discuss, briefly, ways to distinguish cases of maltreatment from cases of poverty and other non-maltreatment stressors where alternative responses may be appropriate.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">How is the world of Mental Health diagnostics changing? This new training will cover a variety of topics that have to do with diagnosing and treating mental health conditions, and a look at multiple diagnostic systems. Epigenetics will be discussed, including their impact on Adverse Childhood Experiences and Developmental Trauma. There will be a discussion of the neurobiological and neuropsychological basis of depression, schizophrenia, and PTSD.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Living in the pandemic has exposed lots of relationship challenges on a personal and professional level, poor communication being one of them. The COVID-19 pandemic resulted in exponential growth in teletherapy services. This paradigm shift did not require training in delivering telehealth services and came without uniform standards of practice. However, it is acknowledged that mental health professionals providing telehealth services need advanced communication skills.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This communication&rsquo;s skill building training will introduce clinicians to the Kendall&rsquo;s Life Languages System of Communication, also known as the 7 Life Languages&trade; Profile (Kendall &amp; Kendall, 2019). This communication tool captures how people communicate based on how they act, think, and feel. Clinicians will learn the concept of conscious communication, which will help them to listen with empathy, speak responsibly, build relationship equity with their clients, and help clients effectively manage conflict.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This presentation will help participants understand how cannabis affects mental health and why people with mental health difficulties use this drug. We will explore options for supporting cannabis users in social service settings. Cannabis is more available across North America than ever before and there are many misconceptions about the effects of this drug on mental health. Participants will receive an overview of the research examining the relation between cannabis and stress, trauma, common health difficulties, and a variety of mental health concerns.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This overview will lead into material on clinical assessment, education, treatment, and harm reduction strategies with cannabis consumers. Material will cover topics including the effects of cannabis use on stress, anxiety, depression, sleep disturbance, pain, anger, psychosis, and more. There will be implications for engagement, education, applying evidence-informed therapies for cannabis use disorder, and relapse prevention.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">More than 50 years after Dr. King's speech, racial disparities continue to exist in various systems, including healthcare, education, the criminal justice system and those impacted by poverty. As a counselor, not only is it unrealistic to be racially colorblind, it is dangerous and does more harm than good. If you don't see my color, you can't see me. And if you can't see me how can you empathize with my racial experiences, accept my whole being and validate my perspectives.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">The world's largest minority group is people with disabilities, and this populations experiences crime, including human trafficking, at far higher rates than their counterparts without disabilities. Yet people with disabilities are often left out of programming, education, and services. Many service professionals also report not feeling comfortable or equipped to work with people with disabilities, despite the reality that they will likely interact with people with disabilities regularly. This presentation provides an overview of disabilities , an introduction to human trafficking, and guidance on how to interact and service human trafficking victims who have disabilities.<br /></span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">In her seminal work introducing Dialectical Behavior Therapy, Marsha Linehan points to the need to teach DBT through metaphors and stories. Comparing something that is abstract, complex, and difficult to something concrete and tangible allows people to go beyond simple cognition, to understanding the more complex realities of life. DBT skills training has received empirical support to be used in the treatment of many different conditions. It has also been shown to enhance social and global functioning.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This training will examine the rationale for using metaphors and storytelling to teach DBT skills, plus practical tips for doing so effectively. Metaphors and storytelling will be used to provide an overview of the four DBT modules (Mindfulness, Emotion Regulation, Interpersonal Effectiveness) as well as the DBT concept of Radical Acceptance.</span></p>

Having all these resources in one place can make it easier for you to bring financial empowerment concepts into conversations you may already be having. This can help the people you work with increase the financial stability in their lives.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Although, sharing this information and tools may feel like a completely different job from your current one, another thing you&rsquo;re being asked to add to your workload, once you&rsquo;re familiar with the resources in this toolkit, it can become natural to integrate its contents into the work you do every day.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">LGBTQ individuals are at an elevated risk of experiencing suicidality and suicide, and there is a need for treatment modalities that can address the unique needs of this community when providing treatment. We know that culturally competent care is one of the most important protective factors for members of the LGBTQ community.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">This course will help attendees gain competency and awareness of the community and unique elements for providing care. It will provide updated information on recent research regarding the issues and evidence based care, as well as how standard practices can be modified to meet the unique needs of this population.

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">Ever wonder what&rsquo;s happening inside of you and your clients as you play? Come explore the primary role your nervous system takes in the play therapy room. Drawing from current research in interpersonal neurobiology, relational neurosciences, and more, this introduction to the nervous system will help you learn how to work with your own nervous system to provide a better regulated and connected presence for your clients. By doing this, you can learn to track, monitor, and work with the underlying physiology driving your behaviors and the behaviors you see in the playroom. In turn, your clients and their caregivers can settle into a felt-sense of safety, allowing them to move towards a deeper level of healing and growth.</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">What we do starts with who we are. Deciding who we are begins with deciding who we really want to be. Recently the President of the United States asked citizens, &ldquo;What kind of nation are we going to be?&rdquo; Political affiliations aside, as social workers and the leaders of moral resilience and courage, this is a call to action directly to us to help our society make the decision to be a nation that puts humanity first. In this training we ask social workers to engage in self inventory to answer one question; what kind of helper will I be?</span></p>

<p><span style="color: #000000; font-size: 12pt;">When children, adolescents, and/or adults learners are poor readers, test-takers, and struggle with math, it reflects on their academic and occupational achievement and raises red flags for teachers and employers. As such these difficulties can inhibit an individual's lifelong goals. This workshop concerns these problems; Academic Anxiety Disorders, which involve Test, Math, and Reading Anxiety. What are the nature of Academic Anxiety Disorders? How do you identify/spot Academic Anxiety Disorders? How can you alleviate/remediate them?
