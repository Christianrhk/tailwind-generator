				What is DeFi? DeFi is essentially a catch-all term for taking existing financial products like loans and porting them over to the blockchain. The idea is to use existing cryptocurrencies to provide financial services using smart contracts. A quick look at DeFi Pulse allows you to see the amount of money that's currently locked up in these projects.			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi loans offer the assurance of complete transparency alongside streamlining access to assets with each transaction without the involvement of intermediaries. DeFi lending presents a simple and easy-to-understand borrowing process. Borrowers have to create their accounts with the DeFi platform and have a crypto wallet.			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi lending is a novel financial service that has exploded onto the scene largely due to its attractive rates and innovative products. DeFi lending platforms help anyone borrow or lend funds, and crypto holders can earn passive income. All this without having to pass all the time-consuming checks required in traditional finance. Sponsored			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi (short for "decentralized finance") is an umbrella term for a wide range of financial tools and dApps in crypto or blockchain. It is aimed to eliminate financial intermediaries. Decentralized finance brings technology to the forefront. It can be integrated into blockchain and cryptocurrency segments, but its abilities are much broader.			</p>

						<p>
				Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an emerging financial technology based on secure distributed ledgers similar to those used by cryptocurrencies. The system removes the control banks and institutions...			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi is a blanket term referring to trustless and transparent protocols that don't require intermediaries to operate. Traditionally, financial services and products have relied on centralized authorities such as banks, financial advisors, and clearinghouses. DeFi has reengineered this power dynamic to provide the same financial services ...			</p>
						<p>
				Most commonly, DeFi lending providers issue loans in stablecoins such as DAI or USDC, with new platforms extending lending capabilities for more volatile currencies such as Ether (ETH), 0x (ZRX), Basic Attention Token (BAT) and Augur (REP). In order to properly function, all loans are secured using cryptocurrencies as the underlying collateral.			</p>
						<p>
				A yield farm is a DeFi venture where you'd invest ( stake) some of your crypto assets, and then receive passive yield in return. As of late, these types of dApps have become very popular, on all of the different blockchains that are used in DeFi ( mainly on Ethereum and TRON, though ). Decentralized Exchanges.			</p>
						<p>
				Cryptocurrency lending is a feature of Decentralized Finance ( DeFi ), in which investors lend cryptocurrencies to borrowers in return for interest payments. If you're holding on to cryptocurrency with the expectation of future price appreciation, you might also receive steady passive income from your assets through lending.			</p>

Decentralized finance brings technology to the forefront. It can be integrated into blockchain and cryptocurrency segments, but its abilities are much broader.			</p>
						<p>
				Flash loans were pioneered by the DeFi lending protocol Aave, and they've been a hot topic of debate since emerging in early 2020. The main reason for this is how they've come to be used to...			</p>
						<p>
				The first digital currency, Bitcoin, aimed to create a decentralized money that was free of central control and available to everyone. DeFi appears to be changing the banking industry, despite Bitcoin's failure to deliver on this promise. DeFi is an open source alternative to any financial service, including savings, loans, trading, and insurance.			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi, or Decentralized Finance, is actually a system of decentralized technologies that allows for decentralized assets - assets that are not cleared through a central institution such as a bank but verified through a dynamic data chain involving a distributed peer-to-peer network of asset holders.			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi Loans it is a new financial service that has made a big impact on its attractive rates and innovative products.DeFi Loans platforms help anyone to borrow or lend funds, and crypto holders can earn passive income. All this without the need to pass the time-consuming checks required in traditional finance. Blockchain technology has opened the gate to DeFi's new decentralized world.			</p>
						<p>
				What is DeFi Lending What is DeFi Lending DeFi Lending is one of the most important aspects of liquidity, and it is the foundation of most cryptocurrency markets and exchanges. One could say that it is the lifeblood of the crypto money flow, as it creates liquidity with which cryptocurrency exchanges can operate.			</p>
						<p>
				"Decentralised finance" or "DeFi," is made up of any number of services in the crypto/blockchain world that aim to disrupt traditional financial intermediaries like banks, hedge funds, and credit card companies. Decentralised finance is not controlled by a single individual or government.			</p>
						<p>
				1) As simple as it can get, Crypto loans are collateralized loans given to a borrower in exchange of his crypto assets as collateral. 2) A borrower obtains fiat loans from lenders in lieu of his crypto assets like Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH) or Litecoin (LTC), which act as securities in absence of repayment of the loan.			</p>
						<p>
				Faster loan processing: DeFi protocols use fraud detection technology and AI to determine the risk factors and loan terms. Every step happens at a blazing fast speed. Permissionless: DeFi gives lenders and borrowers permissionless access to the market. Anyone with a crypto wallet can access DeFi apps on the blockchain, wherever in the world ...			</p>
						<p>
				But DeFi allows users to borrow or lend in a completely decentralised manner while maintaining full custody over their coins. Furthermore, DeFi lending is accessible to everyone without providing any personal details or trusting someone. One such platform based on DeFi is Compound which allows users to borrow cryptos or offer loans.			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi is a decentralized financial service. Until now, most financial services have been centralized, with banks acting as the central regulator of these services and charging customers extra fees. These services can include loans, deposits, currency exchange, etc. DeFi is therefore a solution to the centralization of all these services.			</p>
						<p>
				Defi Lending Traditionally, lending is how banks and other financial institutions make much of their money. They give out loans to businesses in form of overdrafts and other credit facilities to earn an interest calculated in annual percentage yield or APY. Some interests are also paid in annual percentage return or APR.			</p>
						<p>
				Defi lending benefits both lenders and borrowers. It offers margin trading options, allows long-term investors to lend assets and earn higher interest rates. It will also enable users to access fiat currency credit to borrow loans at lower rates than decentralized exchanges.			</p>
						<p>
				DeFi Definition. According to Coinbase, Decentralized finance (DeFi) is an umbrella term that refers to an ecosystem of "peer-to-peer financial services on public blockchains". It enables anyone to lend, borrow, trade, and earn interest with minimal costs, regardless of wealth, status or geography.			</p>
						<p>
				Decentralized Finance is redefining the concept of loans by allowing access to a variety of loans. Overcollateralized loans and flash loans are the two main types of DeFi loans. Overcollateralized loan providers anticipate that users will submit collateral worth more than the loan amount.			</p>
						<p>
				In the cryptocurrency space, lending and borrowing is accessible either through DeFi protocols such as Aave or Compound or by CeFi companies, for instance, BlockFi or Celsius. CeFi or centralized finance operates in a very similar way to how banks operate. This is also why sometimes we call these companies "crypto banks".			</p>
						<p>
				Borrowing with Vauld makes it easy to take out a loan with your crypto rather than sell it. Instead of going through the typical, arduous loan process with the bank, getting a loan with DeFi is convenient and oftentimes immediate. Users simply lock in their crypto as collateral and pay down the loan and the interest to earn it back.			</p>
						<p>
				When it comes to DeFi, lending is likely the first thing that comes to mind. The lending market currently comprises $407 million out of the total $492 million or 82% of total value locked, according to DeFi Pulse. For those unfamiliar, many lending applications require borrowers to lock up an asset (i.e. Ether) in order to take out a loan.			</p>
