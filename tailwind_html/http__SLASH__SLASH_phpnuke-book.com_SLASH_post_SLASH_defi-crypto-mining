				DeFi (or "decentralized finance") is an umbrella term for financial services on public blockchains, primarily Ethereum.

				Namely, the data amount for mining purposes is small. Internet speed of anywhere between 3-5 Mb/s is enough for crypto mining purposes.

Here is some perspective.			</p>

						<p>

				Many DeFi scams will do just that. Evidently, the " 50% of the total token supply held by 5 wallets " example is rather broad. Even if there are around 20 wallets holding 40% of the tokens, this is still a huge red flag. You don't know who the 20 wallets belong to - it might perfectly well be the same person, just with different wallets!			</p>
