				The concept of insurance in DeFi basically focuses on insuring yourself against the losses due to events in the DeFi ecosystem. For example, let us assume that you have some amount of capital locked in a DeFi protocol or platform. You know that any compromises in the DeFi platform can lead to a loss of your capital.			</p>

						<p>
				Simply put, DeFi insurance works as follows. You buy coverage against a specific event. This ensures you are protected against capital loss due to this event. The premium you pay for this coverage depends on multiple factors such as the coverage duration, covered amount, and the covered event. On the other side are coverage providers.			</p>

						<p>
				In the decentralized finance (DeFi) market, insurance may need to play an even more prominent role. Most investors coming from the fiat-based financial system are so used to insurance. Whether it's the FDIC or a private provider, insurance is a ubiquitous element of the financial world. In order to gain widespread acceptance, DeFi needs to ...			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi is a blanket term referring to trustless and transparent protocols that don't require intermediaries to operate.
