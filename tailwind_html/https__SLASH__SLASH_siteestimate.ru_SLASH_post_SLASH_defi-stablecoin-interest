				Stablecoin is an indispensable part of a crypto portfolio, so one may as well put them to good use. Sponsored Sponsored We've listed the best stablecoin interest rates you can get on various platforms here. It'll help you start generating passive income. Sponsored Sponsored 1. Anchor Protocol 2.

				BlockFi is another great choice if you are looking to earn interest on your stablecoins. The platform was founded in 2017 and offers up to 7.25% APY on popular stablecoins such as USDT, USDC, GUSD and more. The interest is accumulated daily but is paid to your account once a month.			</p>

						<p>
				Compound is one of the largest and longest-serving crypto lending platforms in the DeFi space and it currently offers a competitive interest rate of 3.74% for DAI, 7.35% for TUSD, 3.39% for USDT, and 4.70% for USDC. You can start earning on Compound by following these steps: Open your Metamask wallet or any other Web 3.0 wallet.			</p>

				In order to maintain a balance between open access and systemic stability the value of the collateral that needs to be pledged for DeFi loans has to exceed the value of the loans. If for example, a...			</p>

						<p>
				DeFi lending has found its status quo. Industry leaders like Aave and Compound have solidified themselves as the top choice for users to lend and borrow popular DeFi tokens. Maker, the creator behind Dai, has now issued over $3B worth of stablecoins, all on the back of trustless lending using smart contracts.			</p>

						<p>
				A stablecoin savings account resembles a regular savings account in some ways except with a much higher yield. You must know by now that anything with a higher return will intrinsically carry a higher level of risk although with some diversification and good common sense it is possible to attain a very decent return holding high-yield stablecoins.			</p>

						<p>
				Stablecoins have a much higher APR compared to fiat currencies. Crypto platforms offer interest rates up to 12% APR for stablecoin saving accounts. Traditional banks offer very low APR. Enjoying the high yield on a stable coin saving account is a great way against inflation. The best thing about stable coins is they have a stable price.			</p>

						<p>
				Stablecoin yield farming/interest earning. Due to the chop in the market currently, I'm interested in earning interest on stablecoins. However I have never yield farmed before and find the process intimidating. Should I just put the stablecoin in an interest account such as 'Youhodler' and get 12% interest or is yield farming worth the ...			</p>

				Depth.Fi is a stablecoin asset management DeFi protocol, based on the HECO/BSC public blockchain, to provide users with safe, convenient and efficient stablecoin exchange with low slippage, and high-yield asset management services.			</p>

						<p>
				Stablecoins in DeFi When it comes to DeFi, it's commonly known that lending is currently dominating as the largest sector according to Total Locked Value (TVL). More specifically, the emergence of stablecoins like DAI and USDC have been the main drivers of this growth.			</p>

						<p>
				Insane interest rates on stablecoins I've been looking into DeFi recently (specifically liquidity mining on DEXs / providing capital for loans on a protocol like AAVE) and some of these interest rates are just insane. 10-60% on DAI/USDC (Marcus currently offers a mere 50 bips). What's am I missing here?			</p>

				Introduction to stablecoin yields - DeFi Days Introduction to stablecoin yields What is it all about? So… you've got some lousy interest from your traditional bank account. Something like 0.1-0.5% a year. They are actually taking your money and earn higher interest behind your back. With your money.			</p>

						<p>
				You'd think that a stablecoin worth a dollar would command the same interest rate as a dollar, namely zero. But a quick search of lending rates on stablecoins reveals rates of anything from 9% to...			</p>

						<p>
				Specifically, the interest rate hike was partly down to an increased demand for stablecoins—cryptocurrencies pegged to fiat currencies (like the US dollar), said Coinbase. Stablecoins are easily and quickly traded for, say, Bitcoin, perfect when attempting to profit off a last-second trade.			</p>

						<p>
				The interest rate offered for stablecoins (fUSDT, DAI, and USDC) on Sturdy is 18.57%. 4. Compound Compound is a DeFi borrowing and lending protocol built on Ethereum . The Compound protocol can help diversify and grow your crypto portfolio. The protocol will help you earn interest as long as you have your money deposited.			</p>

				This is the first in a weekly series of DeFi stablecoin interest rate market overviews. Each week, we will present the main DeFi interest rates in USDC and DAI along with an attempt to explain how those rates have changed over the last week and why. No one knows for sure what makes markets move - we can only offer speculation.			</p>

						<p>
				A nearly 20% interest rate is unheard of in most of traditional finance. But that's exactly what Anchor Protocol is promising people willing to deposit the crypto stablecoin UST into its...			</p>

						<p>
				There are a number of DeFi protocols that allow users to earn interest/fees on deposits of stablecoin liquidity, while also providing liquidity mining returns. Stablecoins typically offer the lowest yields compared to other volatile crypto assets, but the key difference is that stablecoin holders can adopt investment strategies that leave them ...			</p>

						<p>
				However, a cursory search for stablecoin loan rates finds rates ranging from 9% to 13%, or possibly more. The simple argument is that high interest rates compensate individuals for the chance that the stablecoin would depreciate. However, premier stablecoins like as USDC and Pax (USDP) are entirely backed by high-quality dollar assets, thus the ...			</p>

						<p>
				On this page, I will collect the interest rates of the major crypto lending platforms, in order to find the best place to generate passive income and reach financial independence! CeFi USDC and ETH yields. October 2021. DeFi USDC and ETH yields. October 2021.			</p>

						<p>
				For example, a $1 stablecoin might be backed by $2 worth of ETH collateral. Crypto-backed stablecoins need to be overcollateralised because assets like ETH are volatile.			</p>

						<p>
				Other economic incentives which are likely to fail include trying to control supply/demand for a stablecoin by setting interest rates. In some designs, when the stablecoin breaks below the peg, interest rates are increased to discourage selling and induce buying - you can stake your stablecoin with the protocol which temporarily removes ...			</p>

				Stablecoin Farming Fund 0% Expected annual return High profitability with no anticipated downside risk This fund is for investors seeking high returns, but not willing to risk even the slightest loss of funds. The funds are converted to stablecoins pegged to the USD rate, then invested into 8-12 different defi protocols.			</p>

						<p>
				These high-interest paying deposits are also no different than the usual higher deposit rates from neo banks that want to attract customers. ... At CrescoFin DeFi, we're working on a stablecoin ...			</p>

						<p>
				The total value locked (TVL) on ethereum, a metric that attempts to track the value of tokens deposited in a variety of DeFi protocols, has declined by $124 billion or 60% over the last six weeks ...			</p>

						<p>
				The underlying asset - Stablecoins are a hedge against volatility when sending cryptocurrencies across borders, or purchasing currencies on a centralized cryptocurrency exchange or DeFi platform. For the most part there are no problems, as stablecoins are pegged to assets such as the US dollar, which is itself stable.			</p>
