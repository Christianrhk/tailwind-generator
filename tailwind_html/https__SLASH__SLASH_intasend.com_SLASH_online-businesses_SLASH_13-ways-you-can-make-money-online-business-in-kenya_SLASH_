<p data-block-key="u49s5">Are you looking for an online business idea and to make money online? In this article we will discuss some of the best ideas you can start today. This is in addition to our previous article <a href="https://intasend.com/online-businesses/top-9-online-businesses-that-pay-big-in-kenya/">Top 9 Online Businesses that Pay Big in Kenya</a></p><p data-block-key="pula">Two years ago, the Covid-19 pandemic struck and threw the whole world into a frenzy, leaving no region unaffected. The pandemic changed how people worked, with many businesses forcing their employees to work from home - those who were still fortunate enough to have their jobs. Many were also laid off and were forced to create their sources of income.</p><p data-block-key="3k7o0">The pandemic opened people’s eyes to the need to create a stream of income online. Many people ventured into many online businesses to survive, and most folks also used the opportunity to build values they could exchange for money whenever employers came knocking. <a href="https://www.marketplace.org/2021/12/08/freelance-economy-has-grown-since-pandemic/#:~:text=Freelance%20workers%20have%20contributed%20%241.3,Upwork%2C%20a%20platform%20for%20freelancers.">According to a report on Marketplace</a>, the freelance economy has grown astronomically since the start of the Covid, with freelancers (online business) contributing about $1.3 trillion to the U.S. economy in 2021 only, $100 million more than the previous year.</p><p data-block-key="ahppr">One of the most notable examples of this was the rise of the gig economy. With the ability to work when and where you want to, without having to deal with overbearing employers, came new opportunities to live life on your terms. The ability to work anywhere, anytime, with anyone also led to new ways to interact with the world around you. You could live a completely offline life and still have plenty of opportunities to make money online.</p><p data-block-key="ars24">Making money online is no longer new to people. Online business, such as e-commerce, have been around for a long time. However, the internet has changed the way people do business. Many new online platforms have emerged to provide people with an opportunity to make money online. It has become a common thing for people to do. In the past, people made money online by building websites. These days, people can make money online by writing blogs, creating videos, and more.</p><p data-block-key="94d1h">With a phone or laptop, and access to the internet, you can make a lot of money online as long as you have the skill to exchange for money. If you’ve been looking for online business you could try out, below is a list of 13 ways you can make money in Kenya in 2022.</p><h3 data-block-key="cqgqt">Renting Out Properties</h3><p data-block-key="7ud6b">If you have a spare room or any extra space you won’t need for a while; you can easily rent it out by connecting to people who need it online. For example, if you have a storage unit or even a backyard space you don’t need for a while, you can list it online and connect with people who need extra storage space. This way, you can earn an extra income without needing to sell or store anything. You can make extra money this way without having to lift a finger. This is just one of the many ways to make extra money online.</p><p data-block-key="32ell">This is an easy way to earn a steady income without having to invest a lot of time and energy. Several websites allow you to rent out your space and make some cool money without the need for capital. For example, Airbnb and Homeaway are two of the most popular options.</p><h3 data-block-key="ebkmm">Virtual Assistance</h3><p data-block-key="eapkg">If you’re good at arranging tasks and following laid-out instructions, you can offer your virtual assistance services to individual experts and online businesses. The market for virtual assistant services is expected to grow substantially by the end of 2023. One of the most obvious uses for virtual assistant services is to help people with busy schedules get things done. Instead of scheduling in-person meetings or calling a business owner, you can help your clients answer emails and resolve issues from the comfort of their own homes. This saves time and helps keep your client’s business running smoothly.</p><p data-block-key="4qbnh">The convenience of working as a virtual assistant makes it an ideal career choice for many, especially if you love to work from home and perform some simple tasks. To become a virtual assistant, you must have basic knowledge of Microsoft Office, Google Docs, Canva, and many more.</p><h3 data-block-key="7i6jv">Online Tutoring</h3><p data-block-key="6hgch">Suppose you’re an expert in a particular subject. In that case, you can monetize your knowledge by passing it down to students willing to improve their academic performances and ready to pay for your services. Like any other business, online tutoring requires effort and planning to succeed. You need to find a market for your services, develop a product or service that meets the needs of your audience, and build a platform to allow students to interact with you and other tutors. Even though the process is complicated, it’s possible to make a good living from online tutoring. Just keep in mind that it requires a lot of hard work and dedication to build your business.</p><p data-block-key="fo32e">The best way to make money from online tutoring is to offer a premium service to your students. This means you must provide them with the best possible assistance, whether with in-depth explanations or extra help on an assignment. You can also charge a premium for a one-on-one session instead of a group lesson.</p><h3 data-block-key="b91dj">Podcasting</h3><p data-block-key="b5bf1">Podcasting didn’t have as much attention a decade ago as it does now, and that’s because the internet has changed how we receive and process information online. Today, podcasts are a major source of entertainment and information, allowing listeners to hear experts share their knowledge and experience in their own words. The most popular podcasts in Kenya have millions of downloads and consistently rank top among Africa&#x27;s most popular podcasts. This has led to a major shift in how people consume information, and it’s one of the most important developments in podcasting history.</p><p data-block-key="a47g5">As a podcaster, you could earn money through sponsorships, donations, crowdfunding, merchandise sales, paid ads, and many more. You can also monetize your podcast through affiliate marketing. This means that you can make money when people you have referred make purchases. For example, if you’re hosting a podcast about fitness and someone you’ve referred buys a fitness product, you will get a commission from the fitness product company. You can take inspiration from JohnLee Dumas, a successful Kenyan podcaster who makes up to KES 20 million per month, thanks to his Entrepreneur On Fire podcast.</p><h3 data-block-key="7rfuc">Blogging</h3><p data-block-key="celjs">Blogging has liberated many people financially, and it’s one of the things you can do to help yourself create a reliable source of income in Kenya. Blogging has also helped people create a platform that can help them build their brands. Building a website, especially a WordPress website, can also help you build credibility, and it can help you position yourself as an authority in your niche. If you are a blogger in Kenya, the best way to grow your audience is to blog regularly. You should blog at least once a week, and you should also be consistent.</p><p data-block-key="2f1vj">Earning money from blogging is never easy - it requires hard work and consistency. It also requires you to find ways to increase your revenue constantly. Becoming an expert at this is a great way to increase your income, but it can also help you build a large audience and brand. You can use your platform to share content that helps others, or you can use it to share your expertise and offer a service to help them. Whichever route you take, your primary goal is to build a community of people who trust your opinions and want to learn more.</p><p data-block-key="5vhav">You can monetize your blog by selling ad space to Google (through Google AdSense) or third-party sponsors. This helps you make money when people click on your ad or buy your product or service. You can also make money by collecting affiliate links, which are links to products or services that you don&#x27;t necessarily recommend. This helps you make money when people click on your link and buy the product or service you&#x27;re promoting. Many bloggers use both methods to make their income grow.</p><h3 data-block-key="bu0ip">Content Creation</h3><p data-block-key="4gg9r">Online content creators make a bucketload of money by connecting businesses to their large audiences through content creation. However, it can be difficult for an individual to scale up their output and audience size to the point where they can make a living from their online business. Several companies have cropped up in recent years to solve this problem, offering technical assistance and funding to help creators build large and engaged audiences.</p><p data-block-key="7tr11">Starting can be difficult, but as soon as you get the hang of it, it’ll be easier to make money than ever. All you need as a content creator is to build a community of followers via high-quality content on platforms like YouTube, Medium, Instagram, and many others. These platforms will help you build a large audience of engaged people who will show their support for your content through likes, comments, shares, and other engagement signals. This will help you gain more visibility and reach a larger audience with your content, which will help you build a larger audience and attract more advertisers.</p><h3 data-block-key="ci5i">Freelance Writing</h3><p data-block-key="6tsvq">If you’re a talented writer, you could venture into freelance writing, where you can connect with people who are willing to pay good money for your writing skills. You’ll need to spend some time researching to find a client base, but once you have a few clients, you can generate a steady income. It’s also a great way to gain experience, which could help you land a job as a writer in a large company. There are dozens of jobs like this today, and more will emerge as the digital era continues to change the ways we access information and communicate with each other.</p><p data-block-key="912n7">The key is to find a well-established publication that will give you a steady stream of high-quality work. If you can build a solid network of contacts, you can start making money almost immediately. Even if you can’t build a large network but have a handful of connections, you can still make a lot of money.</p><p data-block-key="17pc1">While most writers are talented enough to write across several niches, as a starter, you don’t need to be a Jack-of-all-trades. You need to work closely with your strengths. If you’re more comfortable writing about how Kim and Kanye could get back together in the future, you should try more entertainment-related content. The hardest part is connecting with employers, which has been made easier, thanks to the several available freelance platforms like UpWork, Fiverr, and Freelancer.</p><h3 data-block-key="2dvm9">YouTube</h3><p data-block-key="co0a3">Suppose a platform has more than 5 billion videos being watched every day with billions of total subscribers and millions of channels. In that case, you should know there are enough opportunities - that’s how big YouTube is. It’s too big to ignore. To make the most of YouTube’s market potential, it’s important to understand the platform and how it works. To start, you need to know about the key features of YouTube: videos, channels, and playlists. Videos are the main content on YouTube and are the reason users come back.</p><p data-block-key="hdsl">Again, you need to find a niche you think will please your audience and create quality content for your subscribers to enjoy. You can earn up to KES 400 per 1000 views, depending on the watch time and the type of videos you create. As soon as you build a list of active subscribers that come to your channel regularly, you should be guaranteed a good sum of money monthly.</p><h3 data-block-key="btkl6">Affiliate Marketing</h3><p data-block-key="33fef">This is an online business most folks barely pay attention to due to its unstable state. However, affiliate marketing has the potential to be one of the highest-paying online jobs in a few years, so it’s always advisable to book an early spot. Affiliate marketing is partnering with brands and companies to get a percentage of what the brand or company makes when someone clicks on an ad or visits their website. The upside of this is that you can make money while you sleep, but the downside is that it’s a full-time job that requires a lot of time, effort, and patience. Because of this, most people steer clear of it and instead rely on other online jobs to make a living. But if you’re willing to put in the time, the money potential is huge.</p><p data-block-key="962li">Affiliate marketing differs from traditional advertising in that the affiliate markets products and services on behalf of the company and not the company itself. This means earning money through affiliate marketing requires a lot of research, writing, and updating skills. However, your money will be enough to pay your bills and provide a comfortable life. Many Kenyan companies allow you to earn some money through their affiliate programs. If you already have a big fan base, you can easily preach companies&#x27; products and services to people and earn some percentage for yourself.</p><h3 data-block-key="r8kj">Ebook Writing and Sales</h3><p data-block-key="36jcj">You can now create helpful ebooks for an audience and sell them through Amazon KDP. You won’t need a publisher or a traditional agent. Instead, you can use the platform and tools to publish your book, create an engaging and profitable book cover, and then sell your book directly to your audience. Most importantly, you’ll make money while you build your brand and grow your audience.</p><p data-block-key="5rflg">This allows you to earn royalties without doing a lot of work. You&#x27;re ready to go; just program your ebook with specific text, images, and links. You’ll earn a percentage of the sale price of each e-book, and you can keep all the profits from your e-book sale. It’s a great way to build a passive income stream without dealing with traditional publishers and promoters.</p><h3 data-block-key="85b4n">Web Development</h3><p data-block-key="80bg7">Only a handful of digital skills are more profitable than web development. As the world’s most in-demand coding language, web development commands top salaries, high-volume job opportunities, and a robust pipeline for job seekers. You don’t need to be a master JavaScript developer to make a good living as a web developer. Even if you only have basic web development skills, you can still make a good living by using the best of what you have. However, you need to improve your skills and hone your web development skills to command higher fees and greater job opportunities.</p><p data-block-key="2onb6">Moreover, the web is transforming companies&#x27; businesses, from marketing to sales. As a web developer, you can lead a fulfilling career and build a solid portfolio that will allow you to advance your career and earn more money. If you have a passion for technology and a desire to learn, there&#x27;s always enough space to be as good as you want.</p><h3 data-block-key="4afdt">Selling Your Old Things Online</h3><p data-block-key="2fcpe">This may not be a long-term money-making scheme, but if you need some quick cash, you can sell things you don’t need again on an online marketplace and make those quick bucks. Some of the best places to sell your junk are <a href="https://techmoran.com/2021/05/26/6-best-kenyan-online-marketplaces-you-can-sell-your-items-on/">online marketplaces like Jiji, Cheki, or Fivesok</a>. If you don’t have time to go to a large garage sale or want to make a little extra money on the side, selling online is a quick and easy way to make money. Just be sure to check the marketplace rules before you list your items because some require that you make the entire sale in person, which isn’t always feasible.</p><p data-block-key="54k6k">The good thing is, once you get more comfortable and learn how things work properly, you can start flipping things by buying at lower prices and selling them at your rates, making some profits in the process.</p><h3 data-block-key="6i23l">Become a Translator</h3><p data-block-key="a3n56">Translating is one of the most underrated skills in the digital space today, but thankfully, people are beginning to realize its importance. If you are multilingual, you won’t find it very hard to land a high-paying translating job if you look in the right places. The first thing you need to do is identify the languages you speak and those you don’t. This will help you narrow down potential areas of specialization. For example, if you only know a few words of Spanish, you won’t be as good at translating Spanish content as someone who knows most of the language.</p><p data-block-key="3jqib">You don’t need to be a native language translator to get a job in the industry. You can learn what you need to know by becoming a language trainer, where you teach others a language you know. A language trainer can work from home, and they’re an excellent way to supplement your income while also learning more about the language you’re trying to learn.</p><p data-block-key="7699h"></p><h3 data-block-key="3sq1p">Conclusion</h3><p data-block-key="fn5id">After setting up your own business, you would like a to integrate a payment system for you to accept payments. IntaSend enables online businesses and freelancers to <a href="/accept-online-payments/">securely accept payments </a>around the globe.
