				Zero Collateral Released out of nowhere in the past week, this project aims to achieve Zero Collateral loans by gradually reducing the collateral amount proportionally to the borrower's repaid interest rates. Put in simpler terms, every time you successfully repay a loan, the next loan will be more attractive.			</p>

						<p>
				However, don't be discouraged if you got no collateral or stake to borrow because DeFi provides zero collateral loons alternatives. Meanwhile, if you have had the need to borrow and are required to make some deposits of either a physical or digital asset, then these are the collaterals.			</p>

				First of all, DeFi lending is anonymous, and the next interesting thing is that a decentralized system does not use any type of physical property as collateral. In the case of a decentralized system, borrowers must offer collateral that is more valuable than the amount borrowed.			</p>

				Here's a simple formula for calculating the amount of collateral you need to secure a specific loan amount at a given loan rate: Collateral = Loan Amount / Loan Rate In Decimal Format Collateral = $10,000 / 0.50 Collateral = $20,000 With Vauld, however, you can borrow up to 66.7% of your crypto's value.			</p>

				Given that the minimum collateralization ratio is 150% and you collateralized your loan with $150 ETH for 100 DAI, any drop in ETH price below $150 would subject your loan to the 13% liquidation penalty.

				What is DeFi? Decentralized finance (DeFi) enables anyone to lend, borrow, earn interest or take out insurance without a bank clerk rummaging through your income and expenses statements and demanding box-loads of documents.			</p>

				Whether it's currently out as a loan, acting as collateral, or in a liquidity pool, there's about $40 billion dollars currently locked in cryptocurrency, according to DeFi Pulse.

				The DeFi loan borrower must offer collateral that should be something of greater value than the crypto loan. For instance, a borrower seeking the loan of 1 Bitcoin will have to offer a crypto coin(s) equivalent to its value. If the need to secure the collateral arises, created smart contracts can secure the collateral crypto coins automatically			</p>

That's what will finally open crypto lending to most people in the world. And that's what we're building at Goldfinch. Unlocking the untapped underwriters Enabling loans without collateral is just the first step.			</p>

Peer-to-peer loans without formal collateral requirements.			</p>

				Decentralized finance (DeFi) loans offer the lending process without the need for a bank or intermediary institution required. Instead, the lending is at a peer-to-peer level. DeFi sees lenders and borrowers find a platform, strike a deal, set up a smart contract and Bob's your uncle.			</p>
