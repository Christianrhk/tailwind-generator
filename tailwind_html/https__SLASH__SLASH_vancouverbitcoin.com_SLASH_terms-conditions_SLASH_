        <p>A) Virtual Currency Exchange: You may use the Services to place Orders for Virtual Currency Exchange.  All Orders will be executed as Spot Transactions for immediate delivery.</p>
        <p>B) Execution: All Orders entered by you and accepted by Vancouver Bitcoin are binding on you from the time of their execution.</p>
        <p>C) Errors: Vancouver Bitcoin provides you with the tools to verify your Order before confirming it to help you catch a mistyped Order. Vancouver Bitcoin will not be responsible for losses induced by mistyped or otherwise wrongly placed Orders. Vancouver Bitcoin makes no guarantee on whether an Order will be cancelled before execution. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event we determine, at our sole discretion, that as the result of a technical issue an executed Order did not reflect the fair market value for the applicable Virtual Currency, such Order shall be cancelled, and you shall be refunded the amount you paid for your Order.</p>
        <p>D) Transfers: Virtual Currency deposits are subject to a minimum number of confirmations by the applicable blockchain before being fully credited to your Account, and Virtual Currency withdrawals are subject to network fees. The network fees are deducted from the amount of Virtual Currencies sent out of your Account. Vancouver Bitcoin shall attempt to process withdrawals and deposits in a timely manner. Vancouver Bitcoin and the Representatives make no guarantee on the timing of those Virtual Currency transfers, and you understand and agree that transfers can be delayed due to a slow blockchain network or Vancouver Bitcoin conducting additional security checks. Vancouver Bitcoin and the Representatives are not responsible for losses and liabilities induced by delayed transfers.</p>
        <p>E) Availability of Virtual Currencies: Virtual Currencies are listed on the Services at the discretion of Vancouver Bitcoin and can be removed or closed at any time. </p>
